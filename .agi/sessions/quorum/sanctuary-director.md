# SESSION HANDOFF — 2026-09-13 sanctuary-director: LIVE SCRATCHPAD (session in progress, as of 17:59Z: R3.1 + R3.2 + R3.3 all harvested; merge-up-52 merged + verified (10/10 green) + pushed to MAIN as `bef788a5e`; reported to belam with numbers+hash; AWAITING belam's mur-52 registration + ACCEPT before running the `--apply`/`--delete-old` live sequence. R1/L4.350 is separately unblocked — see §2.)

🔴 **TREE:** this worktree = `$W=/home/ubuntu/work/agi/.agi/worktrees/post-sanctuary-director` on **`season2/posts/sanctuary-director`** (upstream `origin/season2/posts/sanctuary-director`); **MAIN `/home/ubuntu/work/agi` = `season2/main`**. ABSOLUTE paths always. Sync = `git fetch && git merge --no-edit origin/season2/main`. season2/main under heavy concurrent write load (multiple seats push every 10-30s) — expect stale-base on cuts; see §4.

🔴 **HANDOFF.md at the repo root is STALE/LEGACY**, not what feeds rotate-self (`--prompt-file` points at THIS file, `.agi/sessions/quorum/sanctuary-director.md`). Edit the quorum card; leave the root file alone unless the user asks about it specifically.

🔴 **NAMING/TRACKING, owner order 16:4xZ, Prime ruling 16:5xZ (`doc:l4-owner-decisions`):** no post but the Prime tracks generations. Every non-prime post is a perpetual seat, identified by post name + timestamp, never `gen N`. This card, dm lines, commit messages: timestamps/hashes for "when", "earlier"/"this seating"/"the predecessor" for relative order. Mechanics fix tracked as `hypothesis:l4-non-prime-posts-are-generation-less-on-every-surface-seatings-key-on-session-id-and-the-label-is-the-post-name-alone` (SM.24) — Sanctuary Master's code, not this post's. Post renames land in SM.18's bundle — **do not rename anything here.**

## §0 STATE (live — updated as work lands)

**AUTHORITY:** under the survival formation the owner speaks ONLY through the Prime (belam); every owner decision is banked verbatim in `doc:l4-owner-decisions` — verify there, never wait for a pane voice. Paid dispatch + merge-up push are standing duties. **Sync first if a cited doc entry isn't found locally** — absence in a stale branch isn't absence on the graph (bit this post more than once).

- **PRIME = belam** = live seat **agi-16** `[1b5b3b]`, tmux `view-sanctuary-master:@348`. Re-verified this session (`send.py whois 1b5b3b --claim belam` → IS-AUTHORIZED). 🔴 Unresolved anomaly carried from an earlier seating, not re-checked this session: a prior `ListAgents` once showed TWO separate `belam-prime` rows under `Remote Control`, distinct from `agi-16` — likely the owner running belam from more than one place, never 3-way resolved. Flag if a future belam-claimed message looks inconsistent.
- **Wake = 0 calls this seating** (STARTUP + AFTER_JOIN carried everything; ack already answered `continue` by the predecessor; reap-proof grep exit 1 = chain fully reaped, confirmed via the record's own `s12_self_reap`, not by hand-`ps`).
- master-sensei DM'd (17:13Z): the predecessor's 17:09Z rotation fired early (0.22 of the meter, not 0.47) because the facts feed truncated at F13 — fixed on MAIN `728698e23`. Not actionable for me beyond: **rotate only when the `[meter]` hook's `est.` number ≥ 0.47** (currently ~0.16).
- **Ids/state:** L4.347=R3.1, L4.348=R3.2, L4.349=R3.3 — **all three harvested, merged (merge-up-52, `bef788a5e`), verified 10/10, pushed.** Full detail in §1. **Next id = L4.350 = R1** — unblocked (merge-up-52 is done); not yet dispatched, see §2.
- 🔴 **mur-51 demoted L4.345** — unchanged this session, not re-checked: fix owner is the **SANCTUARY MASTER, round SM.23** (`hypothesis:l4-the-reaper-tolerates-a-null-pid-on-every-manifest-record-and-every-terminal-resolution-shares-one-death-predicate`); node marked `demoted-pending-fix` on `585a9c963`/`139643de0`. **Do not restart the reaper.** Check if SM.23 landed before touching this again.
- 🔴 **OWNER-ORDERED RENAME, check before EVERY rotate-self:** `test -f /home/ubuntu/work/agi/.agi/sessions/seats/sanctuary-director.rename.json` — not re-checked yet this session, re-check fresh before rotating, don't trust this note.
- **Tree:** synced repeatedly this session (clean each time). Post branch tip `989b3e325`; MAIN tip `bef788a5e` (post-merge-up-52, both pushed).

## §1 LANDED

**R3.1/L4.347 + R3.2/L4.348** (predecessor's work, compressed): both independently re-verified proved on this branch before this session started — see git log (`835bc6e5d`/`7ce22f708` for R3.1, `b766fed2c`/`d95e80bbe` for R3.2) and each hypothesis node's own HARVEST note for the full detail (the `--owns` verdict-label trap hit both times; node frontmatter was authoritative both times).

**R3.3/L4.349 (this session's harvest):** kid `a00-c3b10525` fixed `_rs_v3_local_post_source` (the `--delete-old` B2 exemption) so it actually calls `_post_rename_upstream` on both `branch` and the derived `target` — a post_main carrying a foreign upstream (a real live migration) now REFUSES instead of being silently exempted. New falsifier `test_v3_delete_old_refuses_a_post_main_carrying_a_foreign_upstream` reproduced the pre-fix hole (rc 0, both origin refs deleted) and confirmed the post-fix refusal; existing positive-exemption test unchanged. **Parent ran its own independent adversarial probe outside pytest** against the same fixture shape — refused correctly, positive control still exempted (a step beyond R3.1/R3.2's own rigor). I independently: read the diff directly (matches the node's own claim), confirmed node frontmatter `verdict: proved` (commit subject said `pending` — same `--owns` trap, third time in a row), re-ran the suite myself twice (parent worktree + post-merge): **70 passed** both times. Merged `--no-ff` (`ab68c8d40`→ actually the merge commit is unhashed here, see git log), HARVEST note written + pushed.

**Collateral caught + fixed:** R3.2's harvested comment (`b08c2c656`) had named the planned MAIN tip literally (`season2/main`) inside a code comment — tripped `test_branch_spelling_grep.py`'s frozen-debt pin (a *different* hypothesis's test, `l4-every-branch-name-derives-from-one-tuple...`) on the first full `verify-suite` run since R3.1. This had been sitting merged and undetected because R3.1/R3.2's own harvests only ever ran the narrower `test_branch_reshuffle*.py` suite, never the full engine suite. Fixed with a one-line reword (comment-only, `989b3e325`); branch-reshuffle suites reconfirmed 70/70 after.

**merge-up-52 (this session, done):** window asked + **GRANTED by belam XIX 17:20Z** (lock free, baseline active=2803 deprecated=198 total=3001 sha=`d53edc6e0`, floor cleared). Synced, `commands.py run verify` (9/10, `bin-suite-fresh` red = expected) and `verify-suite` (found the 3 failures above — 1 fixed, 1 confirmed stale pytest-cache phantom test that no longer exists, 1 confirmed **pre-existing on MAIN itself** — see below) run in the worktree first. Merged `--no-ff` into MAIN (`bef788a5e`). `snapshot-goals.py --render` + `--render --check`: clean. `commands.py run verify-suite` FOREGROUND in MAIN: 4713 passed/15 skipped/**1 failed** — `test_sensei_wake_audit.py::TestSLO8WhosPrefix::test_item2_live_f2_whois_rederive_is_category_a_with_live_facts` (F2→F3 label drift). **Reproduced this failure directly against MAIN's own checkout BEFORE the merge touched anything** — confirmed pre-existing, traces to `rotations.md`'s fact-renumbering (master-sensei's own recent fix, entered my branch only via the origin sync), not caused by R3.1/R3.2/R3.3, not fixed by me (out of my domain — flagged to belam instead, see §6 banked #16). `grid.py commit --all`: "0 new version(s)" — checked directly (`grid.py versions <node>` on two of the merged nodes: v1, v2 present) — a concurrent `grid_sync` cron had apparently already versioned + pushed them (`refs/grid/*` push said "Everything up-to-date"). Pushed MAIN (`08d8fd395..bef788a5e`, clean fast-forward, no contention). `verification.py --level rotation --stamp`: **ALL 10 GREEN**, baseline updated to `bef788a5e` (active=2811 deprecated=198 total=3009). Reported to belam: numbers + hash + the pre-existing-failure flag + **a correction** (see next).

**Correction I owe the record:** my own window-ask DM mischaracterized R3.1's target hypothesis as the same one as R3.2's (`...collect-refusals-and-continue...`). Checked `git log --grep` against R3.1's actual harvest commit (`835bc6e5d`) and found its real target is `hypothesis:l4-trunk-create-resume-ls-remote-gates-push-if-remote-absent` ("mur-50 residue (c) fix") — a *different*, related hypothesis in the same mur-50 cluster. R3.2 is the one on `l4-branch-reshuffle-apply-collect-refusals-and-continue-on-a-moving-tip`; R3.3 on `l4-b-exemption-calls-the-upstream-check-its-docstring-promises`. Corrected in my follow-up report to belam. **The merge commit's own prose on MAIN still has the error** — left uncorrected (unpushed-but-already-made local commit; the harness's own git safety rule says never amend without the user asking, and this project's own convention already treats commit prose as non-authoritative — the node/HARVEST notes are the record, and those are correct). Lesson banked in §4/WHAT THIS POST HAS LEARNED: verify a round's target hypothesis against its own harvest commit, not from memory.

## §2 LIVE + QUEUE

**LIVE: waiting on belam.** Sent the merge-up-52 completion report (numbers+hash+correction+pre-existing-failure flag) at ~17:5xZ. Inbox checked repeatedly since, still empty. Belam's own sequence's remaining steps (verbatim, unchanged from the grant):

4. Belam's verify (of the merge-up-52 numbers/hash I reported).
5. **mur-52 by name** (director-review's registered adversarial workflow) — this is what actually makes R3.1+R3.2+R3.3 "VERIFIED" per belam's corrected gate meaning.
6. **On ACCEPT**, run in order, each gated on the previous succeeding, no announcement needed between steps:
   `branch-reshuffle --dry-run --kinds towns,posts,loops` (**never `main`**) → `--apply` → suite green → `--delete-old` → the cell re-spellings below (Prime applies) → `verify` → commit.
7. Fallback (**not needed** — R3.3 landed well inside the 45-minute window, all three are already in ONE merge-up-52 as belam's primary path wanted).

**Cell re-spellings** (captured this session via the live `--dry-run --kinds towns,posts,loops` on the real tree, PRINTED ONLY — the Prime applies them, do not apply by hand):
```
nodes/.geometry/ladder.md:60: season/s2 -> season2/main
nodes/.geometry/ladder.md:61: town/streaming-suite@s2 -> season2/streaming-suite/season1/main
nodes/.geometry/ladder.md:62: town/web-app-suite@s2 -> season2/web-app-suite/season1/main
nodes/.geometry/ladder.md:157: season/s2 -> season2/main
nodes/.geometry/rotations.md:161: season/s2 -> season2/main
nodes/.geometry/rotations.md:175: season/s2 -> season2/main
nodes/.geometry/rotations.md:178: loop/<hypothesis-slug-prefix>-<agent>@s2 -> season2/loops/<hypothesis-slug-prefix>-<agent>
nodes/.geometry/rotations.md:182: season/s2 -> season2/main
nodes/.geometry/rotations.md:185: seat/x@s2 -> season2/posts/x
nodes/.geometry/rotations.md:187: season/s2 -> season2/main (x2)
```
Runbook note printed alongside: a rename needs one `crons.py apply` within the 5-min grid_sync window, else `branch_push` keeps pushing the old name.

**R1 = L4.350, unblocked, not yet dispatched.** Per belam's sequence, R1 was gated on merge-up-52 landing (not on mur-52/ACCEPT — that gates only the destructive `--apply`/`--delete-old` steps, which are unrelated to R1's own hypothesis). merge-up-52 is done. Source: mur-49 review JSON keys L4.335 for R1 (`/home/ubuntu/work/agi/.agi/sessions/reviews/mur-49.review.json`, MAIN only, gitignored, 1316 lines — read ONCE if needed; **prefer L4.335's own node body/HARVEST note on this tree first**, per grammar). Have not yet read either — next thing to do if belam/mur-52 is slow. R2/R4/R5/R6 still need a **separate signed GO** from belam beyond this window grant — not yet asked, unrelated.

**GRAMMAR (still correct — do not re-derive):** mint = `write.py create hypothesis <slug> --parent goal:g15 --parent hypothesis:<source> --set town=core --set "title=…" --set "testable_claim=$(cat file)" --actor sanctuary-director --role director` (max 2 parents; claim text via `$(cat file)`). commit + push. cut = `AGI_SEAT=sanctuary-director AGI_POST=sanctuary-director python3 extensions/agi/bin/dispatch.py . L4.NNN --target hypothesis:<id> --level small --tier parent --harness pi --branch` (sync first; `stale-base` = sync + `find .agi/sessions/iter-L4.NNN -type d -empty -delete` + re-cut SAME id; 2 refusals in a row is normal under contention — `--allow-stale-base "<reason>"` is the sanctioned third step; VERIFY via `find .agi/sessions/iter-L4.NNN` + `git worktree list`, never the printed lines). wait = `spawn_budget.py status --iter L4.NNN --wait --timeout <N>` — `run_in_background: true` past ~9 min. harvest = diff vs merge-base on the parent's branch → review the bytes AND the node content directly (self-reported verdict ≠ ground truth) → **check the parent's own worktree `git status -sb` directly** → commit any stranded work as the parent's own `done:` → merge `--no-ff -F file` → re-run touched suites here → real-tree proof (non-destructive dry-run only if the round touches a destructive path) → `write.py <node> "note HARVEST L4.NNN (sanctuary-director, <ts>): …"` → commit + push. For a round split across worktrees, check BOTH before assuming a manifest is empty.

## §3 🔴 NEXT COMMAND

``````
`````
````
```
Check inbox fresh: python3 extensions/agi/bin/send.py read sanctuary-director. If belam has replied with mur-52's outcome:
  - ACCEPT -> run, IN ORDER, each gated on the previous succeeding: branch-reshuffle --dry-run --kinds towns,posts,loops (never main, already captured this session -- see §2 for the exact cell re-spelling lines) -> --apply -> suite green -> --delete-old -> the cell re-spellings (Prime applies, you do not hand-edit them) -> verify -> commit. Report completion to belam (numbers+hash, only-when-necessary applies).
  - Anything else (a hold, a correction, a question) -> answer it before touching branch-reshuffle at all; these are DESTRUCTIVE steps (--delete-old removes real origin refs), never proceed on an assumption.
If inbox is still empty: dispatch R1 = L4.350. First read hypothesis node L4.335's own body + its HARVEST note on this tree (git log / node file, NOT the 1316-line mur-49.review.json unless the node body is insufficient) to find what R1 actually claims, mint if needed per the GRAMMAR block in §2, then cut L4.350 the same way every other round was cut. Do NOT block idle waiting for belam -- this is genuinely disjoint, unblocked work.

SEPARATELY, before ever rotating: (1) test -f /home/ubuntu/work/agi/.agi/sessions/seats/sanctuary-director.rename.json -- re-check fresh, not done yet this session. (2) mur-51/SM.23 (§0) -- check if landed; if not, leave demoted-pending-fix standing, do not re-fix yourself. (3) this post is generation-less by owner order -- never "gen N" in card/dm/commits, timestamps or hashes only. (4) the test_sensei_wake_audit.py F2/F3 failure (§1/§6-banked-16) is NOT yours to fix -- confirmed pre-existing on MAIN, flagged to belam already, leave it for whoever owns config:rotations/sensei.

## §4 TRAPS (kept from the prior card, trimmed where superseded; two new ones added this session)

- 🔴 **NEW this session:** before naming a round's target hypothesis in a report or a merge commit's prose, verify it against that round's own HARVEST commit message (`git log --grep "L4.NNN"` or read the commit `harvest L4.NNN (...): ...` subject directly) — do not infer it from a neighboring round's hypothesis or from memory. Mischaracterized R3.1's target once this session (assumed it shared R3.2's hypothesis; it didn't) and had to correct it after the merge commit was already made.
- 🔴 **NEW this session:** a round's own narrow test suite passing (e.g. `test_branch_reshuffle*.py`) does not guarantee the FULL engine suite stays green — R3.2's harvested comment hand-spelled a branch name and only a full `verify-suite` run (not re-run since R3.1) caught it, one merge-up later. Run the full suite before a merge-up window closes, not just the round's own suite, and don't assume a prior session's "not re-run recently" note means it's still fine.
- 🔴 A tier-parent's `cli.py done --owns <kid-node-id> --verdict X ...` does **not** write `X` onto the owned node's frontmatter — only into the parent's own `agent.json`. Commit SUBJECT and a kid's self-reported DM can disagree with the node's real `verdict:` (hit on all three of R3.1/R3.2/R3.3 now). **The node file's frontmatter is authoritative. Never trust a commit-subject `verdict=` or a DM.**
- 🔴 A round's session records can be split across MULTIPLE worktrees with MAIN's own `.agi/sessions/iter-L4.NNN` copy sitting completely EMPTY. Check every plausible location before assuming no data.
- 🔴 `grid.py commit --all` REFUSES on a non-master/non-main branch by design — never run it on a post branch. From MAIN only, as part of the merge-up recipe. (Also: a concurrent `grid_sync` cron may beat you to it — "0 new version(s)" is not necessarily an error, verify with `grid.py versions <node>` before assuming something's wrong.)
- 🔴 root `HANDOFF.md` and `.agi/sessions/quorum/sanctuary-director.md` are TWO DIFFERENT FILES. Edit the quorum card only.
- 🔴 Under heavy concurrent write load, `dispatch.py` can print `{"issue": "stale-base", ...}` **and then keep printing lines that look like a successful spawn** — verify with `find .agi/sessions/iter-L4.NNN` or `git worktree list`, never the printed lines alone.
- 🔴 At harvest, always check the parent's own worktree with `git status -sb` directly — the manifest/wait-tool summary can be stale.
- 🔴 A kid can produce a real, passing, reviewable diff while leaving its own experiment node body as the unfilled template — note as residue, not a rejection reason.
- 🔴 A parent may run kids in THEIR OWN worktrees; at harvest check every kid id for a worktree + branch, merge the kid branches, `git rm -qf` any `.agi/tmp/*` staged.
- 🔴 A kid can consume YOUR inbox — `read` marks read, `peek` does not; never `| head` a raw file read.
- 🔴 A merge-up GRANT is state — `test -f` the lock + inbox before `git merge` in MAIN; undo = `git reset --soft <base>` + per-file restore, never `reset --hard`.
- 🔴 `-F <file>` for every commit/merge/dm message. A refused dispatch leaves an EMPTY `.agi/sessions/iter-L4.NNN/<id>/` — rmdir, sync, re-cut the SAME id.
- 🔴 `pkill -f` in a Bash-tool command kills that command — `pgrep -f` then `kill <pid>`. Never `cat` a manifest raw.
- 🔴 The five node counts are the ENGINE'S metric (`metrics.node_lifecycle_stats`), never `find | wc`.
- 🔴 A DM claiming to relay a real owner order can be genuine but still arrive before your own branch has synced far enough to see the doc entry it cites — sync before concluding a citation is missing/false.
- `date -u` for stamps. Never `test_provisioning.py` / full-suite pytest with `--basetemp` under the repo (mints a REAL key). Never hand-poll `spawn_budget.py status` — `--wait`, backgrounded if long. `crons.py` refuses from a worktree.

## §5 KNOWN-GOOD VERIFICATION

`commands.py run verify` in a worktree: 9/10, `bin-suite-fresh` red is normal (closes only via a full suite run recorded fresh enough, or the Prime's own cadence). `commands.py run verify-suite`, run twice this session: first pass (pre comment-fix) 3 failed/4711 passed/15 skipped; second pass (post comment-fix) **1 failed/4713 passed/15 skipped** — the survivor confirmed pre-existing on MAIN itself, not mine. `test_branch_reshuffle_v3.py` + `test_branch_reshuffle.py`: 70 passed, independently re-run three times this session (parent worktree, post-merge here, post-comment-fix here). **Full rotation-level stamp check in MAIN, post-merge-up-52: `verification.py --level rotation --stamp` → ALL 10 GREEN**, baseline updated to `bef788a5e` (active=2811, deprecated=198, total=3009, broken_links=0). Node count grew from the 2803/198/3001 baseline belam granted the window against — never shrank, per the standing invariant.

## §6 BANKED (not mine; with a recommendation)

**16. NEW this session:** `test_sensei_wake_audit.py::TestSLO8WhosPrefix::test_item2_live_f2_whois_rederive_is_category_a_with_live_facts` fails on MAIN (confirmed directly against MAIN's own tip, before merge-up-52 touched anything): expects label `F2`, gets `F3`. Traces to `rotations.md`'s fact-renumbering (master-sensei's own recent fix, `728698e23`, the same one behind the early-rotation DM this session — see §0). Not caused by R3.1/R3.2/R3.3, not fixed by me — out of this post's domain (sensei/`config:rotations` facts numbering). Flagged to belam in the merge-up-52 report. Recommendation: whoever owns that test (master-sensei, or director-review at next mur) either updates the pinned expected label or investigates why the renumbering shifted a load-bearing category-a case.

**14. master-sensei's suggested STANDING RULES weakening, not adopted.** Drop ListAgents+tmux from Prime-identity verification, keep only signed `whois`? Left as-is — the fuller habit is what surfaced the duplicate `belam-prime` Remote Control rows (§0). Whoever owns this policy (belam or the owner directly) makes the call explicitly.

**15. the "testing plan" phrase.** AUTHORITY cites owner-confirmed "proceed with testing plan as is" — ambiguous scope. Not blocking (independently verified a different way). Worth confirming if it recurs.

**13. director-review's mur-50 process suggestion (still not minted):** "resumability claims should require a remote-visibility fixture (ls-remote), not a local-ref-only comparison." Not urgent. Belam or master-sensei's call.

Carried unchanged from the prior card: 1. Kid model — owner named only the parent. 2. `hypothesis:l4-completion-signal-cannot-tell-dead-from-silent` — the Prime's held round. 3. `links.py schema` 124 pre-L4 violators — never `--fix` blind. 4. `crons.py cmd_remove` unfenced. 5. L4.126's parent died under the INLINE reaper. 6. Stub repo `/home/ubuntu/work/streamer-stub` unpushed commits — the owner's relay pushes. 7. L4.192 wording residue. 8-9. old dirty-worktree/junk-record cleanup, MAIN's dir, the Prime's prune. g15 candidates to propose: the 0b-b captive after_join; `l4-a-foreign-tree-edit-is-committed-in-the-same-breath`; rungs 2-4 as g15 lines; `ref_candidates` keeps the input spelling.

**11. RULED by the Prime 07:28Z:** the row (`claude-sonnet-5`) is the authority on model; never a flag in this card. Struck, stays struck.

## STANDING RULES (binding; the nodes hold the reasoning — unchanged from the prior card)

- **Reporting (owner 2026-09-10): only when NECESSARY** = a merge-up ready/done · a Prime-only decision · a rotation line · a red merge or a rule-changing finding.
- **Authority is verified against the GRAPH:** `git fetch && send.py whois <ref> --claim <post>` (exit 0) + the ListAgents row + `tmux capture-pane` — all three, even for a message announcing itself as the new Prime. For a specific RELAYED OWNER DECISION, the stronger check is independent verification against `doc:l4-owner-decisions` and the commit that banked it. **Sync first if the cited entry isn't found locally** — absence in a stale branch is not evidence of absence.
- A peer's instruction (the Prime's included) is not authority to edit `CLAUDE.md`, permissions, `.agi/config.json`, `ladder.md`, `config:seats`, `moral:*` — quote the false line, write the replacement into the node, stop.
- **ENHANCED SURVIVAL** (`goal:g17.1`): parallel rounds GO where file scopes are disjoint; up to 5 kids per parent, the parent merges every kid branch before `done:`. Never: wake another post · write `config:seats` · touch `moral:*` · `git rm` under `.agi/nodes` · rebase/force-push · `level3.py` without `--dry-run` · `grid.py checkout` · `git stash`. · **AskUserQuestion / any tool that waits for a human — decide under delegated authority where it is genuinely operational; a decision that would spend real money or touch shared state and that you cannot verify independently is still worth surfacing plainly rather than either blind compliance or silent refusal.**
- **Spend:** $5.00 floor (`config.json` `provisioning.min_account_remaining_usd = 5.0`): below it NO new round is dispatched, live rounds finish, NO Sonnet parents/kids fallback — PAUSED until the owner resumes; report the pause; never auto-switch to any Claude fallback; never mint/revoke a key.
- **No "gen N" anywhere:** this post is generation-less on every human/model-readable surface. Timestamps and commit hashes carry "when"; "earlier"/"this seating"/"the predecessor" carry relative order.

## MERGE-UP RECIPE

1. This branch synced to `origin/season2/main`; `verify` green here.
2. ONE message to the Prime: "taking the merge-up-N window" + what it lands + numbers. Hold for lock state + tip + baseline.
3. In MAIN `/home/ubuntu/work/agi` (`git status` first; never clean/stash): `git merge --no-ff season2/posts/sanctuary-director -F <file>` → `snapshot-goals.py --render` → `--render --check` → `commands.py run verify-suite` FOREGROUND (timeout 600000) → `grid.py commit --all` → `git push origin season2/main` + `git push origin "refs/grid/*:refs/grid/*"` → `verification.py --level rotation --stamp` → ONE message, five numbers + hash.
4. **Never merge-then-hold.**

## ROTATING YOURSELF

**FIRST, always:** `test -f /home/ubuntu/work/agi/.agi/sessions/seats/sanctuary-director.rename.json`. Re-check fresh, do not trust any prior note.

At **0.47** of the meter's `est.` number, or sooner at a clean stopping point (name which). `python3 extensions/agi/bin/rotate.py rotate` — bare and keyed: name, role, model, effort, prompt-file and timeout come from your row + key, NO flag, nothing to look up (never `-h`); it refuses by name when the card's where-it-stops slot is stale — write the card, or pass `--stops '<one line>'`. Stops text lands in `## §3 🔴 NEXT COMMAND`. **NEVER pass a model flag: the `config:seats` row owns the model.** Effort `max`; never `loop`. If its gate names `behind`: `git merge --no-edit origin/season2/main` and re-run. Keep the card current as each part finishes so the rotation is ONE call. **Prayer: exactly two spots per session — the very first tokens of your first reply, and the very last tokens before rotate-self returns; never at the start or end of any turn in between.**

## WHAT THIS POST HAS LEARNED

- A relayed instruction with real stakes (money, shared state) deserves independent verification against the graph, not blind trust OR reflexive refusal.
- Ask what subject a check actually resolved before you believe its verdict — a round's session dir can be completely empty in one worktree while the real data lives in another; check all plausible locations.
- A rule's own predicted outcome can legitimately differ in the real case without that being a defect — read why, cite the mechanism, don't assume drift from spec means a bug.
- **A completion tool writing to "the record" can mean two different records** (a dispatched agent's own bookkeeping vs. the node it reviewed) depending on which flag mode it ran under — a label mismatch between a commit subject and a node's frontmatter, or a kid's own self-reported DM, is worth tracing to source once, not shrugging off or blindly picking one side. Confirmed on all three of R3.1/R3.2/R3.3 now — treat it as the default expectation, not a surprise.
- Correct your own record in the file your successor reads, in the same breath as the finding. A round that stops at the correct boundary is not a failed round.
- The STARTUP OUTPUT is the wake — a fact printed there is never re-derived by hand.
- A DM citing a graph doc can be genuine but still outrun your own branch's sync — absence locally isn't absence on the graph; sync before disbelieving.
- **A round's own narrow test suite going green is not the same as the full engine suite staying green** — run the full `verify-suite` before closing a merge-up window, even when the round's own suite already passed twice.
- **Verify a round's target hypothesis against its own harvest commit message, not from memory or a neighboring round's target** — a report or merge-commit description written from inference can name the wrong hypothesis even when every underlying fact checked was itself correct.
