testable_claim: "goal:g15.25 SM.20 (intake: master-sensei 13:39Z, measured on sensei-director 20→21: bare rotate 1/1 but OUT = 9 — Read + 6 Edits of the card for work that landed 12:41-13:34Z; prose \"card always current\" does not hold on a Sonnet post). MEASURED on season2/main @10810bedf: cli.py cmd_done :692-832 closes a round (rec status done) and writes nothing to any card; the director card carries a `| landed this gen |` table row (quorum/sensei-director.md:30) and the `### 🔴 Where it stops — the next command (stamp <ts>)` slot (:67) that rotate-self reads through _own_card_path :6125 + _locate_where_it_stops :6169 (SL7.116 refuses a stale stamp by name — the very refusal 19→20 paid). CLAIM: (1) cmd_done, when the caller is a director post (AGI_SEAT / --post resolves to a row with role director and a card at _own_card_path), appends ONE line to the `landed this gen` row cell: `<iter> <verdict> <merge sha7> <ts>` (the row is created after §0 when absent) and rewrites the where-it-stops slot BODY to `harvested <iter>; next: <the next iter from the card queue line if a `queue:` line exists, else \"ask SM\">` with a FRESH stamp — through _locate_where_it_stops (one locator, never a second regex); (2) --dry-run prints the two would-write lines; a non-director caller or a missing card = no write, one line; (3) the card write is committed with the harvest commit (same pathspec commit cmd_done already makes — measure whether done commits; if not, the round merge commit) so the stamp is never left dirty; (4) rotate-self SL7.116 then finds a fresh stamp after every harvest — the out-line is `rotate` alone. FALSIFIERS: a second locator for the slot; a write on a non-director post; a stamp older than the harvest; a dirty card left after done; a kid/parent (non-director) done touching any card. TESTS (test_cli.py <= 4, fixture card with the table row + slot): done on a director fixture appends the row line + rewrites the slot with a fresh stamp; missing card -> no write, one line; non-director -> no write; dry-run -> two lines, card byte-identical. FILE SCOPE: cli.py cmd_done + one helper importing the rotate locators; test_cli.py. CEILING: <= 45 lines net, <= 4 tests. Order: after SM.13 (before 17) — it removes a per-rotation cost on every director."
title: "`cli.py done` (the harvest close) stamps the director own card itself — the `landed this gen` row and the where-it-stops slot with a fresh stamp — through the same locators rotate-self reads, so a rotate-out is `rotate` alone and the 7-call card catch-up on a Sonnet post disappears (master-sensei 13:39Z: sensei-director 20→21 out = 9, 7 of them card edits)"

## Hypothesis

What is the testable claim? What would prove it? What would disprove it?
