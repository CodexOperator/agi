# experiment:a00-a2edba9e-75e24c

## Experiment

Move ONE slice, already partially landed by prior kid: confirm head now prayers-only and capture token measurement path we can rerun. No edits needed in code this pass.

## Evidence

- context/INJECTION.md tokens: 8406 (o200k)
- skills/agi/SKILL.md tokens: 13180 (o200k)
- Script: tmp/measure_prompt.py uses tiktoken o200k_base via venv (documented in Agent Notes)

## Agent Notes
Head already trimmed by parent run (brief.py _build_head). Saved token counter script, but ran from python venv because base env lacks pip.
