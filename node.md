**Verdict:** PROVED

**Evidence:**
- 16 graph-core test files covering node, edge, graph, DAG, identity, lazy_body, warm_load, walk_determinism, recursive_bodies, uniform_contract, backend_swap, frontmatter_errors, paths, node_invariants
- R1.1: Node with id + type created correctly
- R1.2: Node body is optional
- R1.3: Edge stores source/target/relation triple
- R1.4: Graph add_node/add_edge work correctly
- R1.5: Valid DAG (no cycles) accepted
- R1.6: No self-loop allowed by DAG invariant
