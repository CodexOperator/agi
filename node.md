# hypothesis:a00-32f358d3-4ee42d

## Hypothesis

`child_working_graph` re-roots a spawned child to the SPAWNER's worktree wherever
`AGI_TREE_PROJECT_ROOT` names one (`hypothesis:l3w4-parent-branch-merge-up`). The
existing tests pin the single hop (parent `--branch` → kid). This chain claims the
override is **monotonic with depth**: `hypothesis:a00-32f358d3-4ee42d` — the
env-root override **descends** through any number of spawn generations (each kid
inherits the deepest worktree from its parent's env and passed root), and it
**never ascends** back toward the main checkout, even adversarially when a
descendant's own passed root resolves main.

## Would prove it

A multi-generation chain (parent `--branch` in worktree W → kid → grandkid →
…) resolves every level's working graph to W's graph — identically and
monotonically — for depth ≥ 2, and a descendant whose passed root names the main
checkout is re-rooted back down to W rather than climbing out of it.

## Would disprove it

Any depth at which the working graph drifts back to the main checkout — i.e. a
generation that resolves `main_graph ≠ wt_graph` while the inherited env still
names W — breaks the never-ascend property the `merge-up` climb relies on.

## Red

`test_child_working_root_descends_deep_never_ascends` in
`extensions/agi/tests/test_dispatch.py` (new, this chain): cuts worktree W,
descends 7 generations asserting every level resolves `wt_graph`, and asserts the
adversarial main-passed re-root back down to W. Proved green against the current
implementation, which already satisfies never-ascend; the test is the guard that
keeps it true.

## Agent Notes
Pinned env-root override descends-never-ascends: 7-generation descent test green, adversarial main-passed re-root back down to worktree held; full suite 2371 passed.
