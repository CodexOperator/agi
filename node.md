# experiment:a00-d1d6ae46-4a5abc

## Experiment

Empirically tested the hypothesis's deletion leg — "duplicate prose tables in both
node bodies DELETED rather than re-derived" — without touching the live tree.
Built a throwaway mirror of the graph root in /tmp/hiroot
(copied `nodes/.geometry/{ladder,seats}.md`, the `sessions/` pin dir, and
`config.json`), then drove the already-built `hierarchy.py --check --root` and
`render --root` against it. Three measurements:

**M1 — baseline mirrors the live drift.** `hierarchy.py --check --root /tmp/hiroot`
→ exit 1, **10 violations**: 6 `orphan_pin` (belam-S1-L3-IX, belam-S1-L3-X,
dir-g1, dir-g15, dir-g16, liaison — that last a live owner-ordered seat with no
row, which only sanctuary-master may add) + 4 `body_table` (the duplicate
"Roles table (command ladder)" rows whose display labels `director (perpetual)`,
`liaison (owner)`, `parent (advisors)` disagree with the frontmatter `role`
values `director`, `liaison`, `parent`). Identical to the 10 violations
e66e7919 measured live — the mirror is faithful.

**M2 — deleting the duplicate table zeroes class 6 and nothing else.** Removed
only that prose table from the throwaway `ladder.md` BODY, replacing it with
one line pointing at `hierarchy.py render`. Re-ran `--check` → `body_table`
dropped **4 → 0**; the 6 genuine orphan pins were unchanged. The prose-vs-
declaration drift class the hypothesis says must be deleted is, in fact,
zeroed by the deletion, and the checker stays live on the real remaining
drift.

**M3 — the checker does not go permanently silent; render stays body-immune.**
Re-seeded a bogus `| 9 | bogus-role | … |` row into the throwaway ladder body:
`--check` fired it again (7 violations), and `hierarchy.py render --root`
printed the bogus role **0 times** (grep -c = 0) — the renderer reads
frontmatter only. Deleting the table is not masking; render never read it.

## Evidence

M1 exit=1, 10 violations (6 orphan_pin + 4 body_table, exact lines above).

M2 after deletion: exit=1, **6 violations, all orphan_pin**, zero body_table:
```
orphan_pin: belam-S1-L3-IX.meter has no seat row in config:seats
orphan_pin: belam-S1-L3-X.meter has no seat row in config:seats
orphan_pin: dir-g1.meter has no seat row in config:seats
orphan_pin: dir-g15.meter has no seat row in config:seats
orphan_pin: dir-g16.meter has no seat row in config:seats
orphan_pin: liaison.meter has no seat row in config:seats
hierarchy.py --check: 6 violation(s).
```

M3 after re-seeding a bad body row: exit=1, 7 violations, the bogus row flagged
as `body_table: roles prose row ['9', 'bogus-role', …]`; `render` grep for
`bogus-role` = 0.

Run on 2026-09-08 in a /tmp mirror; the LIVE tree was not modified (the actual
deletion on `ladder.md`/`seats.md` bodies and the `--check` wiring into
`commands.md` remain sanctuary-master/continue-pass work, and `liaison` still
needs a row only sanctuary-master may add).

<!-- THOUGHT:BEGIN — authored, not derived; carried across regenerating scans. The reasoning behind THIS version. -->
The deletion leg of the one-source hypothesis is now evidence-backed on a faithful mirror: deleting the duplicate Roles table zeroes the 4 body_table violations, leaves the 6 genuine orphan pins untouched, and does not blind the checker (a reseeded bad row still fires) nor the renderer (which never read the body). This version differs from the scaffold in carrying measured before/after deltas for class 6.
<!-- THOUGHT:END -->

## Agent Notes
Deletion leg evidenced on a /tmp mirror: removing the duplicate Roles table zeroed class-6 body_table 4->0, left 6 genuine orphan pins, re-seeded bad row still fires, render reads frontmatter only (bogus role appears 0x).
