---

**Description:** When loader encounters a subdirectory, it asks the schema-registry to resolve the directory name into a node type. Falls back to generic node type when no match. Emits a single aggregated warning naming each unmatched file.

**Files:** `agi-tree/src/graph_core/loader.py`, `agi-tree/tests/graph_core/test_loader_schema_resolution.py`

**Test Strategy:** Loader test against fixture with one schema-matched directory and one unmatched; assert correct types and one aggregated warning.
