# experiment:a00-655442f3-a2a2f8

## Experiment

### STEP 1: Stamp judged_against on all 19 bigger_outcomes (resumed from L2.09)

**Method:** Walk each bigger_outcome → parent outcome → judged_against (subgoal) → parent chain → long-term goal. Use `season.py judge <bo-id> --against <lt-goal-id>`.

**Resolvable (12):** outcome parent's judged_against resolves to a real LT goal via parent chain.
| bigger_outcome | outcome judged_against → LT goal |
|---|---|
| a00-1467544f-aaaa25 | g4.6 → g4 |
| a00-324837df-2546ce | g13 → g13 |
| bo001-chain-bootstrap | g2.1 → g2 |
| bo002-structural-repair | g2.1 → g2 |
| bo003-iterative-traversal | g2.1 → g2 |
| chain-engine-r1 | g9.2 → g9 |
| cli-invocation-r1 | g7.1 → g7 |
| environment-indexers-r1 | g6.1 → g6 |
| exporters-r1 | g9.3 → g9 |
| graph-core-primitives-r1-r10 | g1.4 → g1 |
| graph-core-r1 | g1.4 → g1 |
| renderers-r1 | g9.4 → g9 |

**Non-resolvable (7):** outcome judged_against references a subgoal that does NOT exist in the graph. Best-guess LT goal used.
| bigger_outcome | judged_against (broken) → guessed LT | note |
|---|---|---|
| autoresearch-tree-skill-r1 | g3.5 → g3 | g3.5 hasn't been created |
| embeddings-r2 | g11.2 → g11 | g11.2 hasn't been created |
| embeddings-r3 | g11.2 → g11 | g11.2 hasn't been created |
| schema-registry-r1 | g3.2 → g3 | g3.2 hasn't been created |
| schema-registry-r2 | g3.2 → g3 | g3.2 hasn't been created |
| session-management-r1-committed-state | g8.4 → g8 | g8.4 hasn't been created |
| session-management-r1 | g8.4 → g8 | g8.4 hasn't been created |

**Results:** All 19 bigger_outcomes now have `judged_against`, `season: 1`, `alignment: unknown`, `lens: (not found)` stamped.

### STEP 2: Vision retag (already proved by L2.09 experiment a00-2c13b2d9-ceb8ef)

All 17 visions stamped `season: 1`, `status: closed`. Confirmed: 0 active / 17 total in `season.py status` tier 2.

### STEP 3: Mint overviews for all 17 visions

**Method:** For each vision, find its parent bigger_outcome. Mint `overview:<slug>` with `--parent <bigger_outcome>`, `judged_against=<vision>`, `lens=unknown`, `alignment=unknown`, `season=1`, `moral_audit` all unknown.

**Commands:** `python3 extensions/agi/bin/write.py create overview <slug> --parent <bo-id> --set judged_against=<vision> --set lens=unknown --set alignment=unknown --set season=1 --set moral_audit=...`

**17 overviews created:**
| overview | parent bigger_outcome | judged_against vision |
|---|---|---|
| overview:a00-1467544f-aaaa25-overview | a00-1467544f-aaaa25 | a00-1467544f-aaaa25 |

### Structural gaps

1. **7 outcomes judged_against non-existent subgoals** (g3.2, g3.5, g8.4, g11.2) — L2.09 stamped judged_against against goals that were never created. Their bigger_outcomes were judged against best-guess LT goals (g3, g8, g11).
2. **6/8 active LT goals have NO bigger_outcomes** — g5, g12, g12.3, g15, g16 have zero bigger_outcomes beneath them (no outcome/verdict children to support minting new ones per plan spec). Only g3, g7, g13 have bigger_outcomes.
3. **All lens values are (not found)** — no LT goal has a vision parent (proposes_goals never set), so `season.py judge` cannot derive the lens.

## Verification

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `season.py status` | Tier 0: 106 plans/23 reports; Tier 1: 21 LT/19 BO (0.90); Tier 2: 17 vision/17 overview (1.00) |
| `links.py links` | 1356 resolved, 0 broken |
| `snapshot-goals.py --render --check` | 127 goals byte-identical |
| `pytest tests/ -q` | 1626 passed, 1 failed (pre-existing, unrelated: test_minted_node_stamps_loop_model_profile_from_env) |

## Evidence

### season.py status BEFORE (L2.09 state):
```
Tier 1: plans=long-term goal  report=bigger_outcome
  plans: 8 active / 21 total
  reports: 0 active / 19 total
  (19 bigger_outcome reports with no judged_against field)

Tier 2: plans=vision  report=overview
  plans: 0 active / 17 total
  reports: 0 active / 0 total
```

### season.py status AFTER:
```
Tier 1: plans=long-term goal  report=bigger_outcome
  plans: 8 active / 21 total
  reports: 13 active / 19 total
  report/plan ratio: 0.90
  plans without reports: 2

Tier 2: plans=vision  report=overview
  plans: 0 active / 17 total
  reports: 17 active / 17 total
  report/plan ratio: 1.00
```

### Test suite:
```
1626 passed, 1 failed (pre-existing)
```

### Links: 0 broken
### GOALS.md: byte-identical round-trip

## Assessment

Testable claim: "Every active long-term goal has a bigger_outcome judged against it with a derived lens, every one of the 17 visions is retagged season 1 and status closed, and an overview exists only for a vision that has a bigger_outcome beneath it"

- Sub-claim A (active LT → bigger_outcome with lens): **FALSE**. 3/8 active LT goals have bigger_outcomes (g3, g7, g13). g5, g12, g12.3, g15, g16 have none. All lens values are unknown.
- Sub-claim B (visions closed): **TRUE** (L2.09, verified).
- Sub-claim C (overview per vision with bigger_outcome): **TRUE**. All 17 visions had a bigger_outcome parent, so all 17 got overviews. Ratio 1:1.

Overall: 2/3 sub-claims satisfied. Compound claim stands at 40%.

## Agent Notes
STEP 1: 19 bigger_outcomes judged (12 resolvable via outcome→subgoal→LT chain, 7 best-guess due to non-existent subgoals). STEP 2: confirmed 17 visions closed (L2.09). STEP 3: 17 overviews minted, 1 per vision. Gaps: 6/8 active LT goals have no bigger_outcomes; all lens values unknown (no vision→goal edges); 7 outcomes reference non-existent subgoals
