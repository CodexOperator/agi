# experiment:a00-e2c066ca-e1e284

## Experiment

Closed the last open item on the write-guard chain: the box's real write log
was being polluted by the test suite. Every sanctioned node write is logged
by `node_writer._log_write`, and the L2.13 follow-up flagged that tests
appending to `.agi/sessions/write-log.jsonl` via `snapshot_goals.PROJECT_ROOT`
pollute the real log with `/tmp/pytest-*` entries. Measured live before any
change: **31,169 of 33,169 lines (94%)** in the box log were test paths.

Root cause: `snapshot_goals.write_frontmatter` (reused by level3 / decompose /
publish) logs to `snapshot_goals.PROJECT_ROOT`, which defaults to the real
repo's cwd during pytest even when the node being written lives in a tmp
fixture project — so every test fixture write went to the real log. Two
vectors, both fixed in the engine:

1. **Node-tree writes** (the publishers, and every real node):
   `_log_write` now derives the destination from the written node's own path
   — the project root is the parent of the `nodes/` component — via new
   helper `_node_project_root(path)`, instead of trusting the caller's
   module-global root.
2. **Bare fixture files** (`tmp/n.md`, no `nodes/` component — the snapshot
   serializer tests): when a path has no node-tree component, `_log_write`
   only falls back to the caller's root if the file is actually under that
   root's project; a truly foreign path (test fixture in an unrelated tree)
   is a no-log write, never a leak into a real project's log.

A conftest tried first (monkeypatching `sys.modules` PROJECT_ROOT) was
dropped: `spec.loader.exec_module` does not register the module in
`sys.modules`, so the patch never landed — the engine-side guard is the
reliable fix.

## Evidence

Two regression tests, each red first:
- `test_write_log_follows_node_path_not_caller_root` — a node file in project
  X logged with a different root Y lands in X/sessions; Y/sessions is never
  created.
- `test_foreign_bare_file_is_not_leaked_into_caller_log` — a bare `n.md` in
  an unrelated tree passed a real project root appends nothing to that
  project's log. RED against the pre-guard `_log_write`, GREEN after.

- `python3 -m pytest extensions/agi/tests/ -q` → **1842 passed, 1 skipped**.
- Real `write-log.jsonl` measured across a full suite run: max `/tmp/pytest`
  timestamp **unchanged** before vs after (07:27:26 → 07:27:26) — zero new
  test entries leaked. Previously each run added dozens.
- Controlled re-run of the heaviest leakers (publish/level3/stitch/snapshot):
  log line count flat.
- Real sanctioned writes (`nodes/...` paths) still log correctly; guard
  silent on a real `update_node`.

## Caveat

Payload writes and bare files resolve their project conservatively (path under
root or `root.parent`); a legitimate cross-project write would be a no-log.
No current engine caller does that — every payload is resolved off its own
root. The historical 94% test pollution already in the box log is untouched
(scratch, gitignored); only future pollution is stopped.

## Agent Notes
Closed test-pollution gap on write log: node_writer._log_write now keys log location by written node's path (parent of nodes/ component). Box log was 94% /tmp/pytest lines; now isolated. Engine suite green.

<!-- THOUGHT:BEGIN — authored, not derived; carried across regenerating scans. The reasoning behind THIS version. -->
Parent review (a00-9c2ac512, L3.18): accepted at inconclusive_lean_proved:90. Verified in artifact, not report: _node_project_root exists in node_writer.py (L931) and is used in _log_write; the red-first regression test test_write_log_follows_node_path_not_caller_root exists in test_write_guard.py; write_guard.py check currently warns only on two nodes written by other live agents this iteration, not on anything this kid sanctioned — consistent with the fix. The 94% pollution figure and the 33474->33474 controlled re-run are the strongest evidence; the residual bare-file fallback is correctly flagged as a follow-up, not hidden. Kept the lean at 90 rather than proved because the residual fallback path is unexercised by a test and the full-suite green run predates the two concurrent sibling writes. Next kid: redirect PROJECT_ROOT to tmp in tests for the bare write_frontmatter path, per the residual caveat.
