# Session Management Outcome

## Input Shape
- Graph: nodes/ directory with YAML frontmatter files
- Git: clean working tree with recent commit

## Output Shape
- Restored graph identical to captured state
- Fidelity: 100% (committed state)
- Chains: preserved
- Git HEAD: preserved

## Behavior
- Save: commit nodes/ directory
- Crash: git checkout HEAD -- nodes/
- Restore: loader reads YAML, reconstructs graph

## Edge Cases
- Uncommitted files: NOT preserved (expected - git only tracks committed files)
- Corrupt YAML: loader skips with warning
- Empty nodes/: produces empty graph
