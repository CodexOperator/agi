# experiment:a00-f8722e92-2bf375

## Experiment

Verified the hypothesis `l3-rotate-pin-path-readback` (that after a fix the
meter's pin resolves under `<root>/.agi/sessions/*.meter` never the doubled
`<root>/.agi/.agi/sessions`, and that the successor read-back skips bracketed
log lines like `[DEBUG] MDM settings load completed`). Ran a controlled probe
against the live tree — no code changed.

**Probe A — pin-path doubling.** `find_pin_log()` builds `root/.agi/sessions`.
`locations.find_project_root()` returns the graph dir itself (`.agi/`), so
given that root, `find_pin_log` looks under `.../.agi/.agi/sessions` and
misses a correct pin placed at `.../.agi/sessions/*.meter`. Given the repo
root instead, the same pin resolves fine:

```
A) find_pin_log(graph_dir_root) -> None        # doubled path, pin missed
   doubled path? yes
A) resolve_transcript src = cc_transcript_slug  # fell through to slug heuristic
B) with repo-root: pin = /tmp/<d>/.agi/sessions/belam-S1-L3-X.meter
   src = pin_file                              # same pin, repo-root OK
```

**Probe B — read-back bracket skip.** `_read_first_reply()` returns the first
non-empty line verbatim; it does not filter bracketed log lines:

```
B) _read_first_reply of bracketed+continue -> '[DEBUG] MDM settings load completed'
```

Full suite green, and the three claimed red-first tests are absent:
`grep -c 'test_pin_path_never_doubles_agi_dir|test_readback_skips_bracketed_log_lines|test_readback_reports_diff_when_no_continue' test_rotate.py` → `0`.

## Evidence

1. `python3 -m pytest extensions/agi/tests/ -q` → `1882 passed, 1 skipped`
2. Probe script at `/tmp/probe_rotate.py` output above.
3. `grep -c` of the three named tests in `extensions/agi/tests/test_rotate.py` → `0`.
4. code inspected: `rotate.py` `find_pin_log` (L222) joins `root/'.agi'/'sessions'`;
   `_read_first_reply` (L892) does `text.splitlines()[0]` with no bracket filter;
   `locations.py` `find_project_root` returns the graph dir, not the repo parent.

Neither defect described by the hypothesis is fixed in this tree: the pin
still doubles under the graph-dir root, and the read-back still surfaces a
bracketed log line as the successor's answer. The claimed red-first tests do
not exist, so nothing guards either behaviour — which is why the suite stays
green.

## Agent Notes
Neither claimed fix present: pin still doubles under graph-dir root; read-back returns bracketed line verbatim; three claimed red-first tests absent (grep count 0); suite green 1882 passed.
