# experiment:a00-c6da6609-256a8a

## Experiment

KID A (CP0 + chain 1 A1), 2026-09-14. Every number below tagged MEASURED with its command. Box at start: 4x Neoverse-N1 aarch64, flags `asimd asimddp` and **no i8mm**, 24 GB RAM, MemAvailable 20.2 GB, SwapFree 2.50 GB, disk 35 GB free, loadavg 0.85 (tenants paused).

### 1. Clone

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp ~/src/llama.cpp
git -C ~/src/llama.cpp rev-parse HEAD
```

MEASURED commit `093a2f86c3e37c54fa3e1f9efb17b304f3433abd` (2026-09-14 05:24:05 +0200), 210 MB working tree.

### 2. Q4_0 repack on aarch64 without i8mm — MEASURED answer, before any build

The Q4_0 repack path does **not** need i8mm; it works with asimddp (dotprod) alone. Three citations:

- Repack is a build option, not an ISA gate: `ggml/CMakeLists.txt:152` `option(GGML_CPU_REPACK "ggml: use runtime weight conversion of Q4_0 to Q4_X_X" ON)`, and `ggml/src/ggml-cpu/CMakeLists.txt:582-583` turns it into `GGML_USE_CPU_REPACK`. Nothing in either condition mentions i8mm or dotprod.
- The runtime dispatch at `ggml/src/ggml-cpu/repack.cpp:4573` (`if (cur->type == GGML_TYPE_Q4_0)`) has two distinct NEON branches: i8mm first at `repack.cpp:4579` (`if (ggml_cpu_has_neon() && ggml_cpu_has_matmul_int8())` -> `q4_0_4x8_q8_0`), then a **fallback at `repack.cpp:4585` (`if (ggml_cpu_has_neon() && ggml_cpu_has_dotprod())` -> `q4_0_4x4_q8_0`)**. On this box `ggml_cpu_has_dotprod()` returns 1 (`ggml/src/ggml-cpu/ggml-cpu.c:3811-3817`, gated on `__ARM_FEATURE_DOTPROD`) while `ggml_cpu_has_matmul_int8()` returns 0 (`ggml-cpu.c:3827-3833`, gated on `__ARM_FEATURE_MATMUL_INT8`), so the 4x4 interleave is selected.
- CMake confirmed the ISA at configure time, verbatim:
  `-- Adding CPU backend variant ggml-cpu: -U__ARM_FEATURE_MATMUL_INT8;-U__ARM_FEATURE_SVE;-mcpu=neoverse-n1+crc+crypto+dotprod+noi8mm+nosve`
  with `GGML_MACHINE_SUPPORTS_dotprod=1` and `GGML_MACHINE_SUPPORTS_i8mm=FAILED_TO_RUN` in `build/CMakeCache.txt`.

**Consequence:** repack is live on this box, but with the 4x4 interleave only — the 4x8 and 8x8 kernels are i8mm-gated and unreachable. The repack gain here is the small-interleave one; no i8mm means no 8-row GEMV path. Separate from repack, the plain `vec_dot` table also halves its row count without i8mm: `ggml-cpu.c:230-236` sets Q4_0 `.nrows = 2` only under `__ARM_FEATURE_MATMUL_INT8`, else 1.

### 3. Build — MEASURED

```
cmake -B build -DGGML_NATIVE=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --target llama-bench llama-cli llama-server llama-perplexity -j4
```

**TRAP:** `make` no longer exists in llama.cpp — `make -j4` aborts with `Makefile:6: *** Build system changed: The Makefile build has been replaced by CMake.` The 4 targets must be built through `cmake --build`. First attempt wasted.

MEASURED: configure 5.7 s + 0.2 s generate; build rc=0, wall **268 s (4 min 28 s)** (epoch 1789363512 -> 1789363780). All four binaries produced under `~/src/llama.cpp/build/bin/`: `llama-cli` 1,305,720 B, `llama-bench`/`llama-server` 72,456 B, `llama-perplexity` 70,304 B. `llama-cli --version` -> `version: 0.4.0-dev (build 1, commit 093a2f8)`, `built with GNU 13.3.0 for Linux aarch64`.

### 4. Model ladder — MEASURED, and the named repos were WRONG

The hypothesis named `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF` and `Qwen/Qwen3.5-{0.8B,2B,4B}-GGUF`. Resolved against the HF API:

- `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF` **exists but ships only `Qwen3-0.6B-Q8_0.gguf` (639,446,688 B)** — there is no Q4_K_M in the official repo. Q4_K_M sourced from `unsloth/Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF`.
- `Qwen/Qwen3.5-0.8B-GGUF`, `Qwen/Qwen3.5-2B-GGUF`, `Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B-GGUF` **do not exist**. The API returns `Invalid username or password` for all three; the Qwen org publishes Qwen3.5-0.8B/2B/4B as safetensors only. GGUFs sourced from `unsloth/Qwen3.5-*-GGUF`.

Downloaded to `~/.cache/lm-models/`, 5 files, **total 5,869,770,784 B = 5.47 GiB** (under the 8 GB cap):

| repo | file | bytes |
|---|---|---|
| unsloth/Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF | Qwen3-0.6B-Q8_0.gguf | 639,447,744 |
| unsloth/Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF | Qwen3-0.6B-Q4_K_M.gguf | 396,705,472 |
| unsloth/Qwen3.5-0.8B-GGUF | Qwen3.5-0.8B-Q8_0.gguf | 811,843,840 |
| unsloth/Qwen3.5-2B-GGUF | Qwen3.5-2B-Q4_K_M.gguf | 1,280,835,840 |
| unsloth/Qwen3.5-4B-GGUF | Qwen3.5-4B-Q4_K_M.gguf | 2,740,937,888 |

(The official `Qwen3-0.6B-Q8_0.gguf` is 639,446,688 B, 1,056 B smaller than unsloth's re-quant of the same file — harmless but noted.)

### 5. Load + thinking-off — MEASURED

**All five load and generate with zero errors.** This is the survey's stated unknown — "GDN CPU kernels and Gemma 4 support on this ISA are unverified anywhere" — and the answer is: the Qwen3.5 hybrid models run on aarch64 without i8mm.

Exact thinking-off flag: **`--reasoning off`** (`-rea, --reasoning [on|off|auto]`, llama-cli 0.4.0-dev). `--reasoning-budget 0` and `--reasoning-format` also exist; `/no_think` in the prompt was not needed. Neither `--reasoning off` nor the Qwen3.5 template emitted any `thinking` tag.

Command per model: `llama-cli -m <file> -p "Name the capital of France." -n 32 -st --reasoning off -t 4 -c 512 --no-warmup -ngl 0`. All five answered "The capital of France is **Paris**."

| model | bytes | loads? | cli pp t/s | cli gen t/s |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen3-0.6B Q8_0 | 639,447,744 | yes | 62.3 | 5.1 |
| Qwen3-0.6B Q4_K_M | 396,705,472 | yes | 52.6 | 5.3 |
| Qwen3.5-0.8B Q8_0 | 811,843,840 | yes | 26.8 | 3.4 |
| Qwen3.5-2B Q4_K_M | 1,280,835,840 | yes | 19.5 | 15.7 |
| Qwen3.5-4B Q4_K_M | 2,740,937,888 | yes | 21.2 | 8.4 |

**The cli generation numbers are not bench-grade and disagree with llama-bench by up to 2x** (the 2B reads 15.7 t/s here but 8.66 t/s in llama-bench; the 0.6B reads 5.1 vs 39.2). They include per-turn prompt processing, single-shot sampling and chat-template tokens. Do not seed a ledger from them.

### 6. lm_bench.py — written, tested

`extensions/agi/bin/lm_bench.py` (stdlib only). Wraps `llama-bench -t N -p 512 -n 128 -o json` and prepends to every result row: utc ts, llama.cpp commit, model file + bytes, /proc/loadavg before+after, MemAvailable, SwapFree, pgmajfault delta, top-3 RSS processes, plus `eff_gbps_tg`/`eff_gbps_pp` (tok/s x GGUF bytes / 1e9). One JSONL line per llama-bench row to `.agi/context/local-maxxing/bench/<utc>.jsonl`. Tested once before the A1 loop (file `20260914T053052Z.jsonl`); fixed node from it: llama-bench has **no `--version`** — it prints its usage text, so the commit is taken from the JSON row's own `build_commit` field instead.

### 7. A1 — the reproducibility kill-test (MEASURED, this is the chain's decisive row)

Protocol: `lm_bench.py --model Qwen3-0.6B-Q8_0.gguf -t 4 -p 512 -n 128`, 5x back-to-back then 2x spaced >= 6 min apart (7 rows).

| # | label | pp512 t/s | tg128 t/s | pre-run loadavg | pgmajfault delta |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | A1-b2b-1 | 251.25 | 45.16 | 2.54 | 0 |
| 2 | A1-b2b-2 | 233.06 | 38.90 | 3.54 | 12 |
| 3 | A1-b2b-3 | 237.13 | 42.61 | 3.88 | 1 |
| 4 | A1-b2b-4 | 220.47 | 33.91 | 4.08 | 0 |
| 5 | A1-b2b-5 | 242.86 | 35.89 | 4.22 | 0 |
| 6 | A1-spaced-6 | 168.08 | 35.21 | 0.80 | 13 |
| 7 | A1-spaced-7 | 173.29 | 42.77 | 1.15 | 0 |

All 7 rows, mean / sample-std / CV:

| metric | mean | std | **CV** |
|---|---|---|---|
| tg128 | 39.206 | 4.374 | **11.16%** |
| pp512 | 218.020 | 33.697 | **15.46%** |

Restricted to the 5 runs whose **pre-run** loadavg < 4 (drops b2b-4 at 4.08 and b2b-5 at 4.22):

| metric | mean | std | **CV** |
|---|---|---|---|
| tg128 | 40.929 | 3.903 | **9.54%** |

**CLAIM** (tg128 CV < 10% with loadavg < 4): met on the load-gated subset (9.54%), missed on the full 7 (11.16%). **FALSIFIER** (CV >= 25% at load < 4): does not fire — nothing here is remotely 25%.

**The gate is the confound, and this is the round's method finding.** On a 4-core box a 4-thread llama-bench *is* load 4: the 5 back-to-back pre-run loads climb monotonically 2.54 -> 4.22, so a back-to-back protocol walks its own measurement out of the `< 4` gate. And the two quietest runs are not the fastest — spaced-6 at load 0.80 has the **worst** pp512 (168.08) of all 7, with pgmajfault delta 13, i.e. the 6-minute gap cold-started the page cache. Variance here is page-cache warmth + self-load, not noisy neighbours. The write-down rule for every later tok/s row is therefore: **record the ambient loadaverages before the run AND the pgmajfault delta, and space, don't loop, when the number matters.**

### 8. Per-model bytes-touched ledger (chain 1 A2 seed) — MEASURED single runs

`lm_bench.py`, one run each, t=4 p512 n128; `eff GB/s = tg128 t/s x GGUF bytes / 1e9`:

| model | bytes | pp512 t/s | tg128 t/s | **eff GB/s tg** | eff GB/s pp | load |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen3-0.6B Q8_0 | 639,447,744 | 218.0 | 39.21 | **25.07** | 139.4 | 2.54-4.22 |
| Qwen3-0.6B Q4_K_M | 396,705,472 | 167.5 | 44.67 | **17.72** | 66.5 | 2.37 |
| Qwen3.5-0.8B Q8_0 | 811,843,840 | 180.9 | 32.51 | **26.39** | 146.8 | 3.13 |
| Qwen3.5-2B Q4_K_M | 1,280,835,840 | 54.6 | 8.66 | **11.09** | 69.9 | 3.57 |
| Qwen3.5-4B Q4_K_M | 2,740,937,888 | 25.6 | 6.86 | **18.80** | 70.2 | 4.82 |

**The A2 premise does not hold as stated.** A2 predicted tok/s x bytes lands at 0.5-1.0x a 16-20 GB/s copy bandwidth for every model. Measured effective decode GB/s spans **11.09 - 26.39**, a 2.4x spread: the two Q8_0 models sit at 25-26 GB/s, *above* the predicted band, while the 2B Q4_K_M sits at 11.09, *below* it. There is no single ISA constant across this ladder in these single runs — either the model families have different decode kernels on this ISA, or memory pressure at the 2B/4B (1.3-2.7 GB working set, load up to 4.82) is depressing the larger models. The 2.6x pp512 drop from 0.8B Q8_0 to 2B Q4_K_M is a compute-kernel signal worth its own row. These are single runs, not the 7x protocol, so they are a seed ledger and not a constant.

<!-- THOUGHT:BEGIN -- authored, not derived; carried across regenerating scans. The reasoning behind THIS version. -->
Kid A of three disjoint kids. Scope was CP0 + chain 1 A1 only; kids B (byte-neuron LUT) and C (corpus trainability) untouched. Deviations from the orders, all forced by measurement: (1) the four named Qwen GGUF repos were resolved against the HF API and three do not exist, so the files were re-sourced from unsloth and the exact filenames recorded; (2) `make` is gone from llama.cpp, so the build went through `cmake --build`; (3) the loadavg < 4 gate is self-defeating for a 4-thread bench on 4 cores, so both the gated (9.54%) and full (11.16%) CV are reported rather than one; (4) five extra `lm_bench.py` runs on the rest of the ladder were added because the orders ask for a per-model bytes-touched ledger and the single-shot `llama-cli` t/s numbers disagree with llama-bench by up to 2x. Verdict is a lean, not a prove, because the full 7-row CV misses the 10% bar even though it is less than half the 25% falsifier.
<!-- THOUGHT:END -->

## Agent Notes
A1 tg128 CV 11.16% over 7 rows, 9.54% gated to pre-run load<4 (claim <10%, falsifier >=25% not hit). llama.cpp 093a2f8 built in 268s on N1-no-i8mm; Q4_0 repack uses the dotprod 4x4 branch (repack.cpp:4585), i8mm only gates 4x8/8x8. All 5 GGUFs load+generate thinking-off (--reasoning off). Named Qwen GGUF repos wrong: Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF has Q8_0 only, Qwen3.5-*-GGUF do not exist; re-sourced from unsloth, 5.87GB. Effective GB/s spans 11.09-26.39 - A2's single-constant premise does not hold.

PARENT REVIEW (a00-48ed5e56, TM.01): ACCEPTED at inconclusive_lean_proved:70. Four negative probes run by the parent, one per claim conjunct, all recorded in probes:; the kid passes each. G1 recomputed tg128 CV from the committed JSONL bytes and reproduced the node exactly (full 7 = 11.157%, load<4 = 9.535%), so the lean is honest not an overclaim. W1 read repack.cpp and ggml-cpu.c on the cloned 093a2f8 tree and confirmed the dotprod 4x4 fallback and the i8mm gate. W2 found one wire defect the kid already documented: the first smoke file (20260914T053052Z.jsonl) carries a corrupted top-level llama_commit field equal to llama-bench usage text; all 11 later files carry 093a2f8. Non-material (a labelled test-smoke row) but the committed bytes do carry one wrong field; kept as-is because the grid preserves the version and the fix is in the changed code. W3 confirmed --reasoning off exists and Qwen3-0.6B-Q4_K_M generates rc=0. G3 confirmed lm_bench.py exits rc=1 and writes a _no_result row on empty bench output. G4 confirmed the HF provenance claim exactly (Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B-GGUF 401, unsloth 200, Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF ships Q8_0 only). Caveat: A1s own protocol walks its self-load out of the load<4 gate (4-thread bench on 4 cores), so the gated CV is a subset of a self-stressing run, not an independent quiet-box measurement.
