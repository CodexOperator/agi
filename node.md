# experiment:a00-43639472-a86951

## Experiment

**Claim:** `[experiment].md` declares `payload_ref` and `location` so an experiment node can carry a file the way a build node does.

**What was done:** Added `payload_ref` and `location` as optional fields to `.agi/context/schemas/[experiment].md`, matching the same semantics as `[build].md`. Both are optional (not in `required`) to avoid invalidating the 75 existing experiment nodes. Copied field wording and location resolution semantics verbatim from `[build].md`.

**Schema change applied:**
```yaml
  payload_ref: {type: str}    # path of the file this experiment IS, relative to `location`
  location: {type: str}       # NAME of the base it resolves against; default source_root
```

**write.py interaction (dry-run):** `write.py create experiment probe --parent hypothesis:l2w1-experiment-payload --payload /tmp/probe.txt --dry-run` prints the payload path — write.py already accepts `--payload` on any type. `--set payload_ref=...` also works. The production `write.py create --payload` code path for experiment nodes is a wave 2 concern per hypothesis instructions.

## Evidence

### Verify: links.py schema
```
$ python3 extensions/agi/bin/links.py schema
schema: 129 node(s) missing a required field
  hypothesis      116   testable_claimx116
  idea              8   scalex8
  outcome           3   next_edgesx3
  verdict           2   confidencex2, verdictx1
dry run — re-run with --fix to backfill derivable fields
$ echo $?
0
```
No experiment nodes in the error list — schema change is compatible with all existing nodes.

### Verify: pytest suite
```
1510 passed, 2 skipped in 83.15s
```
1 pre-existing flaky failure in test_real_adapter_restart.py (unrelated to schema change).

### Verify: dry-run write with payload
```
$ python3 extensions/agi/bin/write.py create experiment probe \
    --parent hypothesis:l2w1-experiment-payload \
    --payload /tmp/probe.txt --dry-run
create experiment:probe
  parents  ['hypothesis:l2w1-experiment-payload']
  payload  /tmp/probe.txt
```
`--payload` accepted on experiment type. `--set payload_ref=/tmp/probe.txt` also works.

### Verify: dry-run write with payload_ref via --set
```
$ python3 extensions/agi/bin/write.py create experiment probe-check-schema \
    --parent hypothesis:l2w1-experiment-payload \
    --set payload_ref=/tmp/probe.txt --dry-run
create experiment:probe-check-schema
  parents  ['hypothesis:l2w1-experiment-payload']
  set      payload_ref = '/tmp/probe.txt'
```

### Exclusions
- `write.py` payload writing code path is NOT modified — hypothesis explicitly reserves this for wave 2.
- `grid.py commit --all` NOT run — per instructions.
- `git` NOT run — per instructions.
