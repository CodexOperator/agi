# experiment:a00-751bdc47-46be5e

## Experiment

Tested the full surface of `derive-commands.py --all` against CLAUDE.md and QUICKSTART.md:

1. **Initial state**: CLAUDE.md + QUICKSTART.md had NO COMMANDS:BEGIN/END markers.
   SKILL.md already carried markers from a prior run.

2. **Check detects staleness**: `derive-commands.py --check --all` →
   `would change: ../CLAUDE.md` / `would change: ../QUICKSTART.md` / exit=1

3. **Patch**: `derive-commands.py --all` → patched both files + SKILL.md / exit=0

4. **Verify current**: `derive-commands.py --check --all` → exit=0

5. **Edit cycle**: Added `flux-capacitor-test` command to `commands.md` node →
   `--check --all` → `would change: ../skills/agi/SKILL.md` / `../CLAUDE.md` / `../QUICKSTART.md` / exit=1
   Re-ran `--all` → all 3 files patched
   `--check --all` → exit=0
   Restored node → `--all` → flux command removed from all 3 files → exit=0

6. **Absolute path defect confirmed**: Every rendered command uses literal
   `/home/ubuntu/work/agi/...` paths rather than `<engine>` placeholder.
   The node stores `<engine>`, but `Command.shell()` resolves it at render
   time, violating `goal:g8.2`.

7. **Tests pass**: 1464 passed, unchanged.

## Evidence

- INITIAL: `--check --all` → `would change: ../CLAUDE.md\nwould change: ../QUICKSTART.md` / exit=1
- PATCH: `--all` → `patched: ../CLAUDE.md\npatched: ../QUICKSTART.md` / exit=0
- VERIFY: `--check --all` → exit=0 immediately after
- EDIT CYCLE: add command → check exit=1 → all patch → check exit=0 → restore → all sync → check exit=0
- ROWS: 15 commands rendered identically in CLAUDE.md + QUICKSTART.md COMMANDS blocks
- Absolute paths confirmed: `bash /home/ubuntu/work/agi/extensions/agi/driver.sh --smoke ...`
  (node stores `<engine>/extensions/...` but shell() resolves it at render time)
- `python3 -m pytest extensions/agi/tests/ -q` → 1464 passed


## Agent Notes
Tested derive-commands.py --all against CLAUDE.md + QUICKSTART.md: --check --all detected stale (exit=1), --all patched both + SKILL.md (exit=0), --check --all confirmed current (exit=0). Edit cycle verified: add command → stale detected → re-patch → current. Absolute path defect confirmed (goal:g8.2 violation: <engine> placeholder resolved to /home/ubuntu/work/agi/ literal paths). 1464 tests pass.
