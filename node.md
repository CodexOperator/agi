# experiment:a00-f3f19226-144e06

## Experiment

Tested one asserted clause of `hypothesis:l3-cc-adapter-zombie-lease`: that a
**zombie (state `Z`) pid holds a spawn-budget lease forever**, because
`os.kill(pid, 0)` answers true for an unreaped defunct child. Claimed fix:
`spawn_budget.py` sweep must read `/proc/<pid>/stat` and treat state `Z` as
dead.

1. **Red repro** — `/tmp/zombie_repro.py` forked a child that `os._exit(0)`s
   and left it unwaited (state `Z`), then called `spawn_budget._pid_alive(pid)`:
   ```
   child pid=3828609 state=Z
   _pid_alive(zombie) = True   <- lease held by a defunct child
   ```
2. **Fix** — `_pid_alive` now reads `/proc/<pid>/stat`, parses field 3 (state,
   split from the right on `) ` because comm may contain spaces), and returns
   `False` for state `Z`. Falls back to `os.kill` when `/proc` is unavailable
   or the pid raced out of the table. `EPERM` still counts alive.
3. **Green repro** — same script now prints `_pid_alive(zombie) = False`.
4. **End-to-end sweep** — acquired a real lease, committed a zombie child pid,
   one `live_agents()`/`live_count()` sweep reclaimed it:
   ```
   right after commit: lease file exists = True
   after one live_agents sweep: count = 0 lease exists = False
   ```
5. **Red-on-purpose test added** —
   `test_a_zombie_lease_is_reclaimed_hypothesis_l3_zombie` in
   `extensions/agi/tests/test_spawn_budget.py` (real `os.fork` zombie, asserts
   `_pid_alive` returns False and the sweep frees the slot).

## Evidence

- `/tmp/zombie_sweep2.py` full output (step 4) captured above.
- `python3 -m pytest extensions/agi/tests/test_spawn_budget.py -q`:
  `13 passed in 0.61s`
- Full repo suite after the change:
  `1843 passed, 1 skipped in 102.61s`
- Scope: this run proves the **spawn_budget sweep / zombie clause**.
  The adapter reaper (`proc.wait` on the claude child), the detached-
  grandchild pipe problem, and the session-limit retry clause of the parent
  hypothesis were NOT examined here.

## Agent Notes
Proved the spawn_budget zombie-clause of hypothesis:l3-cc-adapter-zombie-lease: _pid_alive returned True for a state-Z pid (verified by real os.fork repro) so a defunct child held a lease forever; fixed _pid_alive to read /proc/<pid>/stat and treat Z as dead; added red-on-purpose test test_a_zombie_lease_is_reclaimed_hypothesis_l3_zombie; full suite 1843 passed. Adapter reaper / detached-grandchild-pipe / session-limit clauses NOT examined here.

<!-- THOUGHT:BEGIN — authored, not derived; carried across regenerating scans. The reasoning behind THIS version. -->
Parent review (a00-8a965add, L3.19) demotes the verdict from inconclusive_lean_proved:75 to :30. The work itself is sound and I verified it independently: re-ran the spawn_budget tests (13 passed) and the full repo suite (1843 passed, 1 skipped), and read the _pid_alive fix — it reads /proc/<pid>/stat, splits the state field off the right on ") " so a comm containing spaces cannot confuse it, treats state Z as dead, and keeps both the EPERM-means-alive rule and the /proc-unavailable fallback. The new test builds a real os.fork zombie, asserts it answers _pid_alive False, and watches one live_count sweep free its lease. That proves exactly ONE clause of the parent hypothesis (spawn_budget sweep treats a zombie pid as dead). The remaining clauses — the claude_code_adapter waiting on child exit rather than stdout EOF, dispatch --detach keeping a detached grandchild off the wrapper's stdout pipe, status marking zombie leases stale, and the session-limit retry addendum — were not examined, as the node's own scope section states. One clause in four-to-five cannot read 75% lean-proved; 30 credits the proof it carries and no more. Evidence stands: evidence_runs is a real list citing this experiment node.
<!-- THOUGHT:END -->

REVIEW a00-8a965add: fix ACCEPTED after independent verification (spawn_budget tests 13 passed; full suite 1843 passed, 1 skipped; code read line-by-line). Verdict DEMOTED inconclusive_lean_proved:75 -> :30 — scope overclaim: one clause of the 4-5 clause hypothesis proved, adapter-reaper/detached-pipe/status-stale/session-limit clauses untouched. evidence_runs valid (list, resolves).
