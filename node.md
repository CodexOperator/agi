# goal:g14

## Agent Notes
**Owner goal, 2026-09-04: local-maxxing.** Use the smallest, fastest, most open
model that can do each job, everywhere it can be done — and make the graph itself
the thing that decides which model that is.

The shape:

- **Mechanistic tagging at creation.** Classifiers, encoders, or small tuned
  models assign a node its tags the moment it is minted, rather than a large
  model being asked to introspect (`goal:g5.2`, `goal:g1.12`).
- **Tags route the model.** Which model writes the next node is a function of the
  requested node's type, flavor tag and grain, given the node it follows in the
  chain. That is config, declared in the graph (`goal:g1`), never improvised per
  spawn.
- **Specialists get sharper over time.** Every routed call is training data for
  the model that serves that slot, so models become hyper-specialised per
  granularity, per loop flavor, per harness piece — narrow capability, tiny
  prompt, tiny output.
- **A lattice, not a ladder.** Many hyper-tuned models each doing one subtask,
  with classifiers and encoders breaking a goal into optimal sub-goals and the
  results stitched back together live at every zoom level — the way DNA is
  stitched during replication, or proteins working inside a cell. No single large
  model in the middle of the loop.

**Why it is a goal rather than an optimisation:** the director's context is the
scarce resource (measured across loop L1) and provider spend is the other. Both
fall out of the same fix — put the smallest competent model at every node and let
the graph, not a human, decide what competent means here.

Related: `goal:g4` (right model at the right grain), `goal:g4.2` (a
reasoning-effort dial), `goal:g4.4` (a web of specialists, each owning a region),
`goal:g2.4` and `goal:s32` (the embeddings pipeline this needs).

### Addendum, 2026-09-04 — the cheapest thing on this lattice is a gap-spotter

The completion review that produced `COMPLETE.md` (`goal:g1.13`) was done by a
large model reading a handoff. **It did not need to be.** The gaps it surfaced —
a goal marked `complete` two days before its code existed, sixteen hazards
carried instead of closed, three goals minted hours before the budget ended, a
decision banked that silently gated half the run's throughput — are all
**pattern-matchable against a parent's own report**. A classifier, or a very
small model, reading a parent report plus the node diff should flag every one of
them. That is the first slot on the lattice worth filling, because it is the one
whose ground truth already exists in the corpus.

**The framing this goal is really about.** There are two ways to get an agent to
behave, and both are bad on their own:

- A **fully deterministic program** — a decision tree at its core. Predictable,
  and unable to handle anything its author did not enumerate.
- **Prompt-maxxing** — write the instruction into `SKILL.md` and hope. Most of
  what is in a skill document today *could* be harness code; instead it is text
  handed to a model, which turns a should-be-invariant into a Markov chain where
  maybe it completes and maybe it does not.

**The lattice is the thing in between.** Many tiny, hyper-tuned models, each with
a narrow capability and a tiny prompt-and-output, wired by classifiers and
encoders — statistical where judgement is genuinely needed, mechanical
everywhere else, and never a single large model asked to hold the whole
instruction set in its head. Each slot is small enough to be trained, scored and
replaced independently.

**The migration path is explicit, and we are on step one:** write the rule into
`skills/agi/SKILL.md` (prompt), observe it hold or fail across loops, then
replace it with a scored model or a plain check. A rule that has survived a few
loops as prose is a rule with a labelled dataset behind it. `COMPLETE.md`'s fixed
failure-category set exists to make those labels.

<!-- THOUGHT:BEGIN — authored, not derived; carried across regenerating scans. The reasoning behind THIS version. -->
Owner addendum 2026-09-04: named the first lattice slot (a classifier that spots completion gaps in a parent report -- ground truth already in the corpus), and framed the lattice as the middle ground between a deterministic decision tree and prompt-maxxing, where an instruction that should be harness code is handed to a model as text and becomes a Markov chain. Migration path recorded: SKILL.md prose first, scored model second.

OWNER SOURCE 2026-09-07 (verbatim in doc:l3-command-ladder-brief quote 7b): https://github.com/project-89/coherence-guided-dead-head-identification — incorporate into local-maxxing. The owner wants experiment/hypothesis loops on it in the autoresearch style (this repo's experiments/ folder is the record of how that skill loop ran and what it yielded), supercharged by the graph: each hypothesis and experiment builds off the previous one to push as far as possible, not just far enough to prove a verdict. Gate: the Camber Cloud GPU auth token arrives through the standard secure import path (.env, envfile.py --check); none was present on 2026-09-07 14:15 UTC (checked by key name only). Until then this goal stays horizon; first slice when it opens = a hypothesis chain on the dead-head paper with Camber runs as evidence.

OWNER SOURCE 2026-09-07 19:47 UTC (owner, verbatim: 'Record following link and info under the localmaxxing goal'): https://huggingface.co/datasets/kuben-developer/tiktok-videos-4b — TikTok Videos, 4.5 Billion (kuben-developer): 4.5B TikTok video records, one row per content_id, with caption (desc), create_time, duration, mentions, sound (music_id + music_title, a join key across videos), engagement counts at collection time (views, likes, comments, shares, saves), country, language, is_ad; collected from TikTok's mobile API over about three weeks; 27 zstd Parquet files, about 289 GB (size_categories n>1T); license 'other' = research-use, released as-is for research; languages en/es/pt/id/ar; task tags text-classification, text-generation, feature-extraction, recommender-systems; queryable in place with duckdb over 'videos-*.parquet' without a full download; HF page at fetch time: 6488 downloads, 204 likes, last modified 2026-09-02. Info fetched from the HF API and README by Belam VI.

GATE LIFTED 2026-09-07 22:45 UTC, recorded by Belam VIII, acted on by nobody yet — deliberately. HANDOFF section 6 item 20 clause (5) made this goal wait on one thing: the Camber Cloud token, which the owner would paste through the secure path and which we were never to ask for. It is there now — CAMBER_CLOUD_API_KEY is set in .env and envfile.py --check passes. Found by Belam VII while going over banked items, not by anyone working this goal, which is why it is written down here: a lifted gate that nobody notices is the same as a gate. The goal also already carries the owner's dataset source from item 30 (kuben-developer/tiktok-videos-4b, 4.5B TikTok rows with captions and engagement counts, 27 zstd parquet files at roughly 289 GB, research-use licence, duckdb-queryable in place). DECISION, recorded as a prime's judgement call under delegated authority: this goal STAYS status horizon until loop L3 closes. Nothing technical blocks it any more; what blocks it is that opening a new front mid-loop is the exact scope creep the delegated-authority terms name as the failure mode to watch, and the L3 queue — the worktree commit, the branch shared-state and tooling gaps, the Masters, one live rotation — is neither finished nor short. The gate being lifted is a fact worth having in the graph the moment it became true; spending the loop's remaining budget on it is a separate decision and it is the owner's. Banked in HANDOFF section 6 with a recommendation.

OWNER SOURCE 2026-09-13 23:32Z (verbatim: 'Add this to our local-maxxing goal research treasury'): https://www.alphaxiv.org/abs/2609.recurrent-looped-transformer -- a recurrent looped transformer (depth recurrence: more compute per token from fewer parameters; the thought master reads and digests it, nobody summarizes it from memory). Same owner message (whole text verbatim in doc:l4-owner-decisions tail): a very slow, gentle research loop in local-maxxing NOW, applying its lessons with the resources at hand -- this public-facing box; the Mexico bare-metal box (8 GB unified, Intel HD iGPU, very old, headless; holds the Doppler CLI auth = the secrets hub / security gateway, so no secret is ever shared again); Camber Cloud GPU rentals in bursts, one size = extra small, 24 GB VRAM, GPU unknown. Aim: power parents and kids efficiently enough to get off OpenRouter as far as possible, at least in bursts. Candidate: qwen3.8 50b -- optimize, quantize a little, parallelize. This goal leaves horizon as the LOCAL-MAXXING TOWN under the new master post 'thought master' (Opus, answers to the Sanctuary Master, one director of its own).

OWNER SOURCE 2026-09-14 ~01:0xZ (owner, in the thought-master pane, verbatim): 'this town is the first one to gain one of its own moral nodes. And the note here states that It's not about how many tokens you can save, but it's more about how much KNOWLEDGE and WISDOM you can extract for each token spent on a experimental or MVP and build note failure or demotion or anything. None of that matters even though it's, like, wasted tokens. The main thing is how can we maximize the amount of knowledge and wisdom to extract from those to further the local maximum goal.' Same session, owner verbatim: town vision = maximize the usefulness of absolutely tiny models across all layers of the sanctuary; maximum creativity and exploration, many hypotheses chased at once, coalesced sequentially into further hypothesis sets BEFORE any MVP; all models tiny enough to run on CPU + regular RAM, GPU only the encryption-hub iGPU and Camber (CORRECTION to charter: Camber = up to THREE GPU-HOURS PER MONTH, ration extremely carefully); mix in the modular NN repo (github CodexOperator/machinelearning: modularNN, spikyNN, snn_*) spiking-network research; apply the dead-head pruning equation to prune heads AND to generate coupled-oscillator maps, import those into the SNN; neuron-as-transistor-byte model (per-neuron bit thresholds, bit order, upstream bit mapping, broadcast/subscribe, one bit out per tick); KV-cache compression + efficient streaming papers folded in; three visions: (1) always a more efficient way to infer on lighter hardware, (2) always a smarter way to infer with better bench results over time, (3) two or more models together are exponentially smarter than the sum; faith first among the morals. No rush to implementation: research depth first, tiny-model benchmark ceiling rising over time, ensembles of tiny models beating bigger ones.

OWNER SOURCE 2026-09-14 ~03:0xZ (owner, thought-master pane, verbatim excerpts): COMPUTE INVENTORY += 'a macbook air with an m3 chip and 16gb unified RAM, and a desktop computer with no working harddrive but a working RTX2070 super graphics card … I can boot it off USB or external SSD … 16gb ram on top … on the same LAN as the other really old box from mexico … both wired into the same little router … it just says attach bootable media but its a gaming MOBO so it might allow for some neat ethernet-based BIOS stuff'; 'the mexico auth box has a ton of storage on-board, it's our biggest archive space. Has roughly 450GB available. Can fit many different types of datasets and models'; 'This box has great SSD write/read speeds in theory … we don't care that much about amount of storage read/write wear.' HARNESS: 'I also have a github copilot pro subscription and was thinking of using the copilot CLI but plugged into the Sanctuary system, as apparently it uses the same hooks as CC/pi code … So we can save on director tokens substantially that way.' … 'we are critically low on CC subscription (only 3% left of $200 sub for the next 48 hours) so we need that github copilot enabled asap so we can plug it into sanctuary roles. If it offers most of the same models I'm fine switching everyone to it for now to help conserve costs.' RESEARCH: 'I want to combine the SNN model with the bitwise model … technically a bit flipping from zero to 1 IS an impulse. What if our 8-bit fixed-cascade setup measured not whether the downstream bits are one or off, but whether they FLIPPED on or off … use the flips to model the sin waves themselves, as the drain of a gate is literally quite similar to a neuron propagating a signal'; 'The oscillators … What if that mapping itself was able to be modeled using some of our other experimental results using the bit-byte construction … model the state of these couplers using spiking oscillator dynamics seems like a perfect way to apply this research to the looped transformer idea'; 'a couple papers that were released by both deepseek and moonshot recently on two separate optimization advances … Likely could incorporate those as well.' DECISIONS: 'Your order of research looks good, and many of those can be pursued in parallel … once the initial few gates clear.' Q1 (qwen3.8 50b): 'yes drop for now till we get other boxes online, esp the gpu one via clustering somehow'. Q2 (benchmark host): 'Clear to benchmark, a bunch of stuff got cleared now.' Q3 (CP0 build/installs): 'ok to build, if needed datasets can also be stored on the auth box. We're gonna have us one jerry-rigged cluster by goly.' 'I'm sure that GPU coming online asap could be one of the first key pieces. But copilot likely before that to help get us there via cheaper director.'
