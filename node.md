**Broader outcome:** graph-core provides the foundational primitives (Node, Edge, Graph) for the entire capillary DAG memory system. All other modules (chain_engine, renderers, embeddings, schema_registry, environment_indexers) depend on these primitives. The DAG invariant ensures the graph never forms cycles, making find_chains() termination guaranteed.

**Properties achieved:**
- Generic Node Primitive (R1): id + type + optional body
- Generic Edge Primitive (R2): source + target + relation triple
- Identity Scheme (R3): slug-based collision resistance
- Frontmatter File Persistence (R4): YAML frontmatter storage
- Recursive Node Bodies (R5): arbitrary content per node
- Directory-Walking Auto-Discovery (R6): load entire graph from disk
- Warm-Load Caching (R7): LRU cache on GraphBuilder
- Pluggable Persistence Layer (R8): abstracted backend contract
- Portability Contract (R9): relative paths for repo portability
- Bootstrap Command (R10): CLI to initialize new graph context
