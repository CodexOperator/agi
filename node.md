## Experiment

SD.03, kid a00-b23fb1d6. Parent: hypothesis:l3w4-rotation-announces-itself. The build (rotate.py announce helper + tests) had LANDED in a prior slice of this chain — rotate.py lines 1793-1936 hold `_announce_rotation`, `_compose_announcement`, the recipient-derivation `_derive_receivers`, and the durable monotonic `sequence.json` counter; a prior kid already corrected the false "no cross-session push" finding on `l3w4-shared-mail-alert` (CORRECTION note dated 2026-09-08). My slice: VERIFY the built machine actually satisfies the hypothesis, run all its tests red-vs-green, confirm the live wiring against the record-writing rotation paths, and record what the tests DO and DO NOT cover.

WHAT I RAN (all in `/home/ubuntu/work/agi`):
- `pytest extensions/agi/tests/test_rotate.py -k 'announce or sequence or compose'` → 8 passed, 64 deselected in 0.16s. Covers: `_compose_announcement` carries all five fields plus the `seq:` stamp; a non-prime rotation dms every derived recipient exactly once; the PRIME routes to `rotation-alerts` room never quorum; loop-success announces EXACTLY once and loop-refusal none; rotate-self-success announces once and refusal none; the `sequence.json` counter is monotonic + durable across reloads; the announce writes the sequence file and stamps `seq: 1`; a refused loop does not advance the counter.
- Full engine suite `pytest extensions/agi/tests/ -q` → 2190 passed, 1 skipped in 125.19s. Tree green.

WIRING AUDIT (grep + read): `_announce_rotation` is called at TWO sites — `cmd_loop` success (line 1229, after writing the `continue`-confirmed record) and `cmd_rotate_self` success (line 2220, after the record, BEFORE the own-window kill, following the L3.39 ordering the brief demands). Both are reached only after the success record is written; both refusal/inconclusive paths return before announcing. A `seq` counter read is exposed as `rotate.py sequence` (`_current_sequence`) — the seat-visible "is my order current?" check the scope extension demands.

## Evidence

- `test_rotate.py` announce/sequence block, lines 1520-1747 — 8 tests, all asserting the exact conditions in the hypothesis' PROVE clause (one announcement per success, refusal announces nothing, recipient drops a dead window, five fields present, sequence monotonic). All 8 pass.
- Full suite: `2190 passed, 1 skipped`.
- `sequence.json` does NOT yet exist on the live repo — correct: it is written only by a successful rotation, and none has run since the counter landed. Expected, not a defect.
- FINDING (genuine, unmeasured-defect-in-hypothesis-text): the hypothesis names THREE rotation paths — "spawn, loop, rotate-self" — but scopes the announce to "the same moment the rotation record ... is written". `cmd_spawn` writes NO rotation record (it is a provisioning primitive that builds+launches a successor window and returns; success is confirmed later by loop/rotate-self read-back). So the "spawn" clause and the record-writing condition are mutually exclusive: there is no spawn-time record to announce alongside. The two paths that DO write a record both announce correctly. The machine is consistent and complete against the record-writing semantics; the hypothesis text over-names spawn.
- LIVE-HALF STATUS: the hypothesis' closing proof ("this prime's own next rotation announces itself with zero hand-typed send.py calls, readable in recipients' dm files") was NOT exercised this round — that requires a real prime rotation event, which does not happen inside a single kid slice. Machine half proved; live delivery (real `send_dm` / `send_room` plumbing from a live process) not yet observed.

VERDICT REASON: inconclusive_lean_proved — the machine half is fully proved by 8 targeted tests + a green full suite and correct write-order wiring; the live prime-rotation half is built but not yet observed end-to-end, which is exactly the case the brief says to mark inconclusive_lean_proved with the honest reason. Spawn-path over-naming in the hypothesis text is a caveat, not a disproof: it writes no record, so there is nothing for it to announce and its absence from the record-conditioned announce is correct.

## Agent Notes
Verified the landed rotation-announce build: 8 targeted tests + full engine suite (2190 passed) green; _announce_rotation wired to loop+rotate-self success (not spawn, which writes no record). Live prime-rotation half not exercised this slice.
