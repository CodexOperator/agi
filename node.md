# config:seats

The seat registry (hypothesis:l3w4-seat-registry, goal:g17). One row per
active seat declares that seat's whole configuration — name, ladder role and
tier, harness, model, effort, settings, session kind, personality ref,
handoff file, meter pin ref, who rotates it, and the goal it owns. The graph
carries the seats; `dispatch.py --seat <name>` and `rotate.py meter --seat
<name>` read them.

Owners (owner text 2026-09-07, recorded in
`.agi/context/l3-command-ladder-brief.md`): the orienting correction (owner 4)
overrides the earlier draft (owner 3) — **quorum is opus on max, director-kids
are opus on high effort; parents and kids as they are now.** Thus belam
fable-5.1/max/ultracode, the three advisors opus-5/max (no ultracode), the
liaison sonnet-5/high owning goal:g17, and one opus-5/high director per
perpetual goal besides g17 (dir-g1, dir-g15, dir-g16). pi parents/kids (tier-0
role `parent`/`kid`) are unchanged, as the owner said — they were not granted
seats.

`pin_ref` is seat-stable: `.agi/sessions/<name>.meter`, written by the code
that already writes `<agent_id>.meter`, keyed off `AGI_SEAT` instead of an
agent id — no graph write, no race on this node.

The `locations: {}` field is present because the `config` type requireds
`locations`; this node's real declaration is `seats`, so the field is empty
rather than a redundant restatement of the shared filesystem facts in
`config:secrets`.

## Agent Notes
OWNER GO, 2026-09-07 22:5x UTC (verbatim: '6.36: go' and, on the open half, 'as far as quorum leave on opus max'). Applied by Belam VII as the owner's own ladder assignment, actor owner. CHANGED, three rows only: dir-g1, dir-g15 and dir-g16 move from claude-code / claude-opus-5 / high to harness pi, model ~z-ai/glm-flash-latest, effort high - the mechanism for this was built and reviewed in L3.32 (hypothesis:l3w4-director-kids-on-glm) and the kid deliberately left the data alone because the owner had only said 'I am considering'. Now it is a decision. UNCHANGED, deliberately: the three advisor seats stay claude-opus-5 max - the owner settled the open quorum question in the same breath, and GLM flash is too weak to arbitrate a 1-1-1 morals split; the liaison stays claude-sonnet-5 high because the owner named that model for the seat that talks to them and it is already the cheapest subscription seat; belam stays fable-5.1 max ultracode (item 13). ONE CONSEQUENCE THE OWNER SHOULD KNOW, changed here rather than left silently wrong: the three flipped rows also move session_kind from tty to fire-and-forget, because a pi spawn is not an interactive session and cannot hold a tty seat the way a claude-code seat does. That means these three director-kids are NOT yet perpetual - they run and exit - and they become perpetual only when hypothesis:l3w4-seat-rotation-loops lands its live proof (rotate.py alarms and rotate-self exist and are tested but no live tmux rotation has ever been observed). Until then this change buys the token saving, not the persistence.

OWNER REVERSAL, 2026-09-07 23:0x UTC, superseding the GLM go of one hour earlier (verbatim: 'Okay looking at my rate of use now, I can honestly feel comfortable using sonnet directors on max setting' and 'a sonnet-powered director-kid self-loop would help a lot with stability now and it should be plenty cheap enough still to enable smooth operation today'). dir-g1, dir-g15 and dir-g16 are now harness claude-code, model claude-sonnet-5, effort max, session_kind tty - reverted from the pi plus GLM flash rows set at 22:5x. THE REASON IS THE CONSEQUENCE NOTE ON THE PREVIOUS VERSION, and it should be read as the system working rather than as churn: the GLM rows bought token saving but NOT persistence, because a pi spawn is fire-and-forget and cannot hold a tty seat, so those director-kids would have run and exited. The owner read that, priced Sonnet max against their actual rate of use, and chose PERSISTENCE over the cheaper model. A claude-code Sonnet seat can hold a tty session and therefore can self-loop, which is the whole point of a perpetual seat. STANDING SHAPE, owner's words: 'Let's keep that shape until we really make the whole thing harness-agnostic top-to-bottom' - directors on the subscription, pi and OpenRouter for parents and kids, and no further seat migrations until harness-agnosticism is real end to end (hypothesis:l3w4-workflows-config-maxxed owns the workflow half, and its pi path is still a stub). hypothesis:l3w4-director-kids-on-glm is NOT retired by this - its mechanism is real, tested and now proven reusable, and it is the path back if the subscription tightens again; it is simply not the configuration in force. WHAT THIS MAKES URGENT: hypothesis:l3w4-seat-rotation-loops. The owner wants a self-looping director-kid TODAY and the loop is built but has never run live - rotate.py alarms and rotate-self exist with 7 named tests green and NO live tmux rotation ever observed. That live proof is now the gating work for the owner's stated goal, not a nice-to-have.
