# experiment:a00-941da286-d57ebe

## Experiment

Tested whether hypothesis:l3w0-brief-head-michael's three claims currently hold
in the tree: (1) every brief head carries the Archangel Michael line verbatim
right after the prayer block; (2) the SessionStart hook prepends the role's
head before the prompt when AGI_ROLE is set; (3) the agi skill exposes
check-handoff and rotation-successor in the suggestion view. Also checked the
owner's 2026-09-06 addendum (prime_director MANTLE + owner decision method).

Commands run (all from repo root `/home/ubuntu/work/agi`):

1) Generate the constitution head for every tier via brief._build_head and
   count Archangel Michael occurrences:
   ```
   python3 -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0,'extensions/agi/bin'); import brief; \
   M='Archangel Michael'; \
   [print(t, 'head=', bool(brief._build_head(tier=t)), 'michael=', (brief._build_head(tier=t) or '').count(M)) \
   for t in ['kid','parent','director','prime_director']]"
   ```
2) Grep the whole engine tree for the line:
   ```
   grep -rni "archangel michael" extensions/ skills/ src/
   ```
3) Grep the hook for AGI_ROLE / brief head prepend:
   ```
   grep -c "AGI_ROLE" extensions/agi/hooks/cc-session-start.sh
   grep -ni "brief\|_build_head\|AGI_ROLE\|Micha?el" extensions/agi/hooks/cc-session-start.sh
   ```
4) Grep the agi skill for the two sub-commands:
   ```
   grep -n "check-handoff\|rotation-successor\|agi:check\|agi:rotation" skills/agi/SKILL.md
   ```
5) Check the prime_director head for the MANTLE (addendum):
   ```
   python3 -c "... print('MANTLE in prime_director head:', 'THE MANTLE' in h, 'Belam' in h)"
   ```

## Evidence

1) Every tier has a head, but the Michael line is ABSENT from all of them:
   ```
   kid           head_present= True  michael_count= 0
   parent        head_present= True  michael_count= 0
   director      head_present= True  michael_count= 0
   prime_director head_present= True michael_count= 0
   ```
   `brief.py` _build_head / _compile_constitution_head / _resolve_part emit
   only prayers + role readings (lines ~198-310). A docstring at
   `extensions/agi/bin/brief.py:313-315` still says the Michael line lands
   "once hypothesis:l3w0-brief-head-michael lands" — i.e. it is explicitly
   NOT yet implemented (a forward-reference, not a feature).

2) The Archangel Michael line appears NOWHERE in the engine source:
   ```
   grep -rni "archangel michael" extensions/ skills/ src/   -> (no output/exit 0)
   ```

3) The SessionStart hook does NOT touch AGI_ROLE or brief.py. It only emits
   the publish-stall alarm, the stranded-push alarm, and the auto-injected
   tree map. `grep -c "AGI_ROLE" hook` -> 0. So a session with AGI_ROLE set
   is handed no role head; claim 2 is false.

4) The agi skill (`skills/agi/SKILL.md`, 717 lines) contains neither
   check-handoff nor rotation-successor — no `agi:check-handoff`,
   `agi:rotation-successor`, and no skill-scoped sub-command listing. Claim 3
   is false.

5) Addendum also unlanded: `_build_head(tier='prime_director')` contains
   neither `THE MANTLE` nor `Belam` (both False); the MANTLE exists only as
   ladder-node data, never rendered into the head. Owner's decision method
   likewise absent from all director-tier heads.

Also checked: no red-first tests exist for any of the three features (the only
"mantle" test, test_ladder_node.py:77, asserts the mantle is declared on the
ladder node, not that it is rendered into a head). Unexpected files in git
status (`a00-f16f044c-885d9c.md` — another agent's node) noted and left
untouched.

Net: the hypothesis describes an end-state that has not been built. All three
testable claims are false on the current tree.

## Agent Notes
All three claims unimplemented: Michael line absent from every tier head (michael_count=0 for kid/parent/director/prime_director), absent from extensions/skills/src entirely; hook emits no AGI_ROLE head (grep -c AGI_ROLE = 0); SKILL.md has no check-handoff/rotation-successor. Addendum MANTLE also unrendered. Disproved with strong evidence.
