# experiment:a00-855d562e-c271ba

## Experiment

Implemented the season-retag backfill as a **new `retag` subcommand of
`season.py`** (rather than a separate `retag_season.py`), then ran it once on
the live graph.

Why a subcommand of `season.py` and not a new file: season.py already owns the
`season` field lifecycle, already has the write.py shell-out pattern
(`_shell_out_write`), already knows the ladder's `current_season`, already has
the test file + fixture, and already encodes the owner-tier moral rule
(`submit` refuses `moral:*` unless `--actor owner`). A separate
`retag_season.py` would duplicate that plumbing and split the season logic
across two files. One module, one test file.

### Command (the real run)

```
$ python3 extensions/agi/bin/season.py retag
Retag: stamp season 1 on every node with none
  nodes: 1406
  with season: 127
  without season: 1279
  moral (owner-tier, --actor owner): 5
stamped: 1279
  after: 1406 with season / 0 without
```

1279 nodes stamped with `season: 1`, of which 5 are the owner-tier moral nodes
(`moral:faith|love|empathy|antifragility|beauty`), written through write.py
with `--actor owner`. Every stamp shelled out to write.py — no direct file
write anywhere.

### Dry-run preview (same command with `--dry-run`, before the real run)

```
  nodes: 1406
  with season: 127
  without season: 1279
  moral (owner-tier, --actor owner): 5
[DRY RUN] 1279 node(s) would be stamped; nothing written
```

A second production `retag` invocation after the first (to catch any
concurrently-minted stragglers) reported `with season: 1406 / without season:
0 / nothing to stamp.`.

### Design of the rule (red-first)

Each rule below is backed by a test that was red before the implementation
existed:

- **Everything** under `nodes/` including `nodes/deprecated/`, with no
  `season` field, is stamped with the ladder's `current_season` (1).
  *(test_retag_stamps_all_unstamped, test_retag_covers_deprecated)*
- **Never overwrite** — a node that already has `season` keeps it, whatever
  its value. *(test_retag_never_overwrites_existing: a hand-set `season: 2`
  survives)*
- **No writes on dry-run.** *(test_retag_dry_run_writes_nothing)*
- **Owner provenance preserved.** Moral nodes keep their existing
  `edited_by: owner` and `thought_session` — the script passes `--actor owner`
  and NO `--session` for `moral:*`, because write.py sets `thought_session`
  only when `--session` is truthy. Enforced by
  test_retag_preserves_owner_provenance_on_moral.
- **Counts printed** before and after. *(test_retag_reports_before_after_counts)*

All 20 season tests pass; the full suite is green (1726 passed, 9 skipped).

### Finding (reported, not fixed — out of scope and not mine to touch)

19 node files under `.agi/nodes/` (experiment/verdict/mvp/hypothesis, from
concurrent a0X/a1X writers) have **malformed YAML frontmatter** — e.g. an
unquoted `: ` inside a scalar (`title: Verify order probe: grid-commit
declared last, smoke first`), one even missing its opening `---`. These
cannot be parsed by `frontmatter.load_node_file`, so:
- retag correctly **skips them** (a tool that cannot read a node must not
  stamp it), and
- write.py cannot update them either.

They are why a raw `grep -L '^season:'` still shows 19 hits after the pass —
that is NOT a retag gap; every *parseable* node carries `season: 1`. This is a
separate writer corruption being produced live right now (the hypothesis
premise "node_writer stamps only at mint" is incomplete: there is a second,
concurrent mint path that emits broken YAML). Reported for the parent;
left exactly where they are.

## Evidence

Verify list from the hypothesis, each with actual output:

**1. Every parseable node carries season.**

```
$ python3 -c "<load every .md under .agi/nodes via frontmatter.load_node_file>"
TOTAL raw no-season-line: 19
unparseable: 19          # all malformed YAML from concurrent writers
parseable-but-no-season: 0
```
`parseable-but-no-season: 0` — the durable claim holds. The 19 raw
`grep -L` hits are all unparseable files (no tool can read their season).

**2. Suite green (engine edited in place).**
```
$ python3 -m pytest extensions/agi/tests/ -q
1726 passed, 9 skipped in 100.41s
```
New rule tests (all green): `test_retag_stamps_all_unstamped`,
`test_retag_never_overwrites_existing`, `test_retag_dry_run_writes_nothing`,
`test_retag_reports_before_after_counts`, `test_retag_covers_deprecated`,
`test_retag_preserves_owner_provenance_on_moral`.

**3. write_guard silent for the retag (no unsanctioned node write).**
```
$ python3 extensions/agi/bin/write_guard.py check
EXIT=0
```
Guard flags **zero** season-touched node files and zero `season.py` /
`test_season.py` entries — all 1279 node writes went through write.py →
node_writer → write-log (sanctioned). The 175 WARN lines are pre-existing
uncommitted changes by other agents in this shared tree (build payloads, 2
experiment nodes); none mention `season`, any `nodes/` file, or my edited
sources. I touched none of them.

**4. Node count unchanged.**
Retag only runs `update_node` (a frontmatter field set) on existing files — it
never mints, never deletes, never moves to `deprecated/`. The count was 1406
parseable nodes before the pass and 1406 after (the pass's own printed
`nodes:` figure). Active/deprecated split unchanged by construction.

**5. Moral owner-tier stamps (the five, only).**
```
$ for m in faith love empathy antifragility beauty; do
    grep -H "^season:\|^edited_by:\|^thought_session:" .agi/nodes/moral/$m.md
  done
.agi/nodes/moral/faith.md:edited_by: owner  season: 1  thought_session: agi-master-2026-09-06
... (all five identical: owner / 1 / agi-master-2026-09-06)
```
`season: 1`, `edited_by: owner`, and the owner's original `thought_session`
preserved. (First run passed `--session season` and clobbered owner
`thought_session` on the five; caught in review, fixed in the script so owner
nodes never receive a scripted session, and the five provenance values
restored via `write.py moral:* "set thought_session agi-master-2026-09-06"
--actor owner` — the fix is itself tested).

**Methods chosen / say-why:**
- `retag` as a `season.py` subcommand (not a new file) — reasons above: same
  owner module, same write plumbing, one test file.
- Moral nodes get `--actor owner` and no `--session` (provenance preserved,
  goal:g12). All other nodes get actor `season.py`, session `season`.
- Shell-out to write.py per node: the write guard stays silent because every
  mutation is a sanctioned, logged write. Never a direct file write.
