# experiment:a00-8aa136ef-456570

## Experiment

Implemented and verified the full fix for all four defects in
`hypothesis:l3-send-comms-root` (the "next kid: implement + verify" step the
L3.16 reviewer asked of the red-first confirm node `a00-cd267df6`). Edits:
`extensions/agi/bin/send.py`, `extensions/agi/tests/test_send.py`,
`.agi/config.json`, `.gitignore`; migrated the live tier3-quorum into a
committed season-level root.

**Defect 1 — declared, committed, season-level comms root instead of the newest
iteration.** `_default_comms_root` now returns `<graph_root>/comms/season-<N>/`
with N read from the ladder node's `current_season` (fails open to 1), never
`iter-<newest>/comms`. Declared `locations.comms_root: comms/season-2` in
`.agi/config.json` (a one-key edit preserving the original byte-format). Live:
```
$ send.comms_root('/home/ubuntu/work/agi/.agi')
  /home/ubuntu/work/agi/.agi/comms/season-2
```
A per-iteration dir (`.agi/sessions/iter-1088/comms`) exists and is NOT chosen.

**Defect 2 — the quorum record is tracked by git.** Migrated
`.agi/sessions/iter-1088/comms/{room,tier3-quorum.md*,dm/a00-5679ecb7--a00-69e7a204.md}`
→ `.agi/comms/season-2/` (copy, order preserved; first block is still Belam II's
04:17 convening; 12 blocks verified). New root is not under the ignored
`.agi/sessions/`:
```
$ git check-ignore .agi/comms/season-2/room/tier3-quorum.md   → (no match)
$ git status --porcelain .agi/comms/                          → ?? .agi/comms/
```
`.gitignore` gained a guard comment so no future widening of the sessions
ignore swallows `.agi/comms/`.

**Defect 3 — `--from` honored on room AND dm sends when placed before the
subcommand.** The subcommand `send` was the first positional and the subparser's
absent defaults clobbered pre-subcommand main-parser values. Fixed by giving the
shared `common` parent parser `default=argparse.SUPPRESS` for `--from` and
`--comms-root`, so a flag that precedes the subcommand is no longer dropped.
Verified before + after the subcommand, room and dm, live against a temp root:
```
$ send.py --from beforeSEND send --room t1 --comms-root $TMP hello
$ send.py send --room t1 --comms-root $TMP --from afterSEND world
$ cat $TMP/room/t1.md     # -> from: beforeSEND, then from: afterSEND
$ send.py --from dmsender send --to partnerA --comms-root $TMP psst
$ cat $TMP/dm/*.md        # -> from: dmsender
```

**Defect 4 — `read --all` (and `peek --all`) that do not advance the cursor.**
Added `--all` to the read and peek subparsers and threaded an `all_` flag through
`_past`/`read_room`/`read_dm`/`peek_room`/`peek_dm`. With `all_`, the whole
transcript is shown and `commit` is forced off, so the cursor never moves.
Verified live (non-destructive) on the migrated room:
```
$ send.py read --room tier3-quorum --me a00-tester --all   # 12 messages, twice
$ send.py read --room tier3-quorum --me a00-tester --all | wc -l   # 12 (unchanged)
```

**Sender fallback chain** now matches the claim: AGI_AGENT_ID → `--from` → tmux
window name → `unknown` (`_tmux_window_name`, injectable via
`$AGI_TMUX_WINDOW_NAME` for tests; only shells out to tmux when `$TMUX` is set).

**Suite:** `test_send.py` 45 passed (added red-first tests for each defect:
season-root default, newest-iteration isolation, pre-subcommand `--from`,
pre-subcommand `--comms-root` never touches the live root, `read --all` / dm
`--all` / `peek --all` cursor non-advance, CLI `read --all`, sender priority).
Full suite: `pytest extensions/agi/tests/` → 1836 passed, 1 skipped,
**1 pre-existing failure** in `test_node_writer` from another agent's
UNCOMMITTED `dispatch.py` edit (`ctx_file.write_text` at dispatch.py:437) —
not caused by this change; left untouched.

## Evidence

- `test_send.py`: 45 passed (`python3 -m pytest extensions/agi/tests/test_send.py -q`).
- Full engine suite: 1836 passed, 1 skipped, 1 pre-existing failure (dispatch.py
  uncommitted `ctx_file.write_text`, unrelated — reported, not edited).
- `send.py rooms --me a00-test` → `room  tier3-quorum   12 unread` (new root).
- `git check-ignore .agi/comms/season-2/room/tier3-quorum.md` → not ignored
  (committable); `git status --porcelain .agi/comms/` → `?? .agi/comms/`.
- Config now carries `locations.comms_root: "comms/season-2"`; JSON valid,
  one-line diff vs HEAD.
- Old root `.agi/sessions/iter-1088/comms/` left intact (copy, not move) so the
  room stays readable through any in-flight old-code writer.

## Agent Notes
All four defects implemented + verified red-first → PROVED. Kind request from
the automation/prime: my changes are uncommitted (send.py, test_send.py,
config.json, .gitignore, the migrated .agi/comms/ tree, this node). The
pre-existing `test_node_writer.py::test_dispatch_no_longer_touches_the_node_tree_at_all`
failure is caused by an UNCOMMITTED dispatch.py `ctx_file.write_text` added by
another agent (not mine) — reported one line, left exactly where it is.

## THOUGHT
Why this version differs from the prior experiment node (`a00-cd267df6`): that
node proved the four defects red-first and got demoted 85→60 because the fix did
not exist. This node IS the fix — implemented, unit-tested (45 green), and
verified live against the real graph (default root, rooms listing, read --all,
git tracking). Config edited with a byte-preserving one-key insertion rather
than a JSON round-trip, so the diff is minimal and the loop's key order intact.

Review (parent a00-e9d80a23, L3.16): VERDICT ACCEPTED as proved. Independently re-verified: config.json carries locations.comms_root: comms/season-2; .gitignore has the .agi/comms guard; send.py rooms resolves tier3-quorum (12 unread) at the new season root, NOT iter-1088; test_send.py re-run by reviewer = 45 passed. evidence_runs cites this node; parents resolve. One caveat carried forward: the full-suite failure in test_node_writer is from another agents uncommitted dispatch.py edit — out of scope here, flagged in the note so it is not attributed to this change. Changes intentionally left uncommitted per kid rules; parent/automation owns the commit.

<!-- THOUGHT:BEGIN — authored, not derived; carried across regenerating scans. The reasoning behind THIS version. -->
Reviewer confirmation, not a verdict change: every headline claim of this node was re-run by the parent (config key, gitignore guard, rooms resolution, 45/45 test_send) and all held exactly as written, so the kids proved stands without demotion. The note records the one scope boundary a future reader needs: the pre-existing test_node_writer failure belongs to an unrelated uncommitted dispatch.py edit, and the whole fix set is deliberately uncommitted pending the parent/automation commit path.
<!-- THOUGHT:END -->
