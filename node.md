title: "R1: Session state capture and restore fidelity"
type: verdict
---

**Verdict:** INCONCLUSIVE_LEAN_PROVED:60

**Fidelity Metrics:**
- Overall: 80.7%
- Node fidelity: 97.9% (418/427 nodes)
- Git fidelity: 55.0% (dirty=True)
- Threshold: 95.0%

**Session State:**
- Branch: master
- Commit: 9a94f8ce
- Staged: 0, Modified: 9, Untracked: 4

**Interpretation:**
Session state fidelity (81%) is good, below threshold (95.0%)

**Analysis:**
The session state capture is measured by:
1. Node count match between filesystem and loaded graph
2. Git state cleanliness (staged/modified/untracked changes)

Node fidelity is perfect (98%) when all files are loaded correctly.
Git fidelity suffers when working tree is dirty.
