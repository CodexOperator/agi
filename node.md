# experiment:a00-e85e494a-5b05e1

## Experiment

**Testable claim from parent hypothesis `hypothesis:l2w1-report-schemas-floors`:**
"[outcome], [bigger_outcome] and [overview] have min_parents 1 and carry the judgment record and season fields, and every existing node of the three types still validates"

**Action:** Edited three schema files in `.agi/context/schemas/` per the instructions in the hypothesis's Agent Notes section — per the season-ladder design brief (`season-ladder-and-morals-brief.md §1`):

### Changes per file

#### `[outcome].md`
- Added fields: `judged_against` (str), `lens` (str), `alignment` (str, regex: aligned|adjust|unknown), `adjust` (str), `season` (int), `season_parents` (list), `tokens_in` (int), `tokens_out` (int), `cost_usd` (float), `accepted_bytes` (int)
- `min_parents` already 1 — no change needed
- No `min_parents_by_type` existed — no removal needed
- Replaced body text with ladder rationale: outcome is tier 0 report, judged against its (sub)goal through the lens of the LT goal above; judgment record stamped on the report node; counts measured at season close, never enforced as floors.

#### `[bigger_outcome].md`
- Added fields: `judged_against` (str), `lens` (str), `alignment` (str), `adjust` (str), `season` (int), `season_parents` (list), `tokens_in` (int), `tokens_out` (int), `cost_usd` (float), `accepted_bytes` (int)
- Changed `min_parents` from `4` to `1`
- Removed `min_parents_by_type: {verdict: 2, outcome: 2}`
- Replaced body text with ladder rationale: bigger_outcome is tier 1 report, judged against its LT goal through the lens of the vision above.

#### `[overview].md`
- Added fields: `judged_against` (str), `lens` (str), `alignment` (str), `adjust` (str), `season_parents` (list), `tokens_in` (int), `tokens_out` (int), `cost_usd` (float), `accepted_bytes` (int), `moral_audit` (dict — five-key dict with value aligned|violated|unknown + evidence pointer)
- `season` (int) already present — unchanged
- Changed `min_parents` from `3` to `1`
- Removed `min_parents_by_type: {bigger_outcome: 3}`
- Replaced body text with ladder rationale: overview is tier 2 report, judged against its vision through the lens of the morals above; added `moral_audit` shape documentation.

### Verify commands and actual output

**1. `python3 extensions/agi/bin/links.py schema`**
```
schema: 129 node(s) missing a required field
  hypothesis      116   testable_claimx116
  idea              8   scalex8
  outcome           3   next_edgesx3
  verdict           2   confidencex2, verdictx1
dry run — re-run with --fix to backfill derivable fields
```
Analysis: All 129 violations are pre-existing (hypothesis missing testable_claim, idea missing scale, outcome missing next_edges, verdict missing confidence/verdict). No new violations were introduced for outcome, bigger_outcome, or overview types. The 3 outcome nodes missing `next_edges` were missing before the edit — unchanged.

**2. `python3 -m pytest extensions/agi/tests/ -q`**
```
1497 passed, 2 skipped in 78.23s (0:01:18)
```
All tests green. No regressions.

## Evidence

The three edited schema files (diff from git status):

```
 M .agi/context/schemas/[outcome].md
 M .agi/context/schemas/[bigger_outcome].md
 M .agi/context/schemas/[overview].md
```

All three files now declare:
- `spawn.min_parents: 1` (replacing the higher floors in bigger_outcome and overview; outcome was already 1)
- No `min_parents_by_type` floors
- The judgment record fields (`judged_against`, `lens`, `alignment`, `adjust`)
- Season fields (`season`, `season_parents`)
- Telemetry roll-up fields (`tokens_in`, `tokens_out`, `cost_usd`, `accepted_bytes`)
- `overview` additionally carries `moral_audit` (dict)

No existing nodes of the three types gained new schema violations. Existing violations (3 outcomes missing `next_edges`) are unchanged from before the edit.

## Agent Notes
Edited [outcome].md, [bigger_outcome].md, [overview].md: set min_parents to 1, dropped min_parents_by_type floors, added judgment record fields (judged_against, lens, alignment, adjust), season, season_parents, telemetry roll-ups (tokens_in, tokens_out, cost_usd, accepted_bytes), and moral_audit on overview. Verified: links.py schema shows no new violations for these types (129 pre-existing violations unchanged); pytest 1497 passed, 2 skipped.
