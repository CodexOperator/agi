**Description:** Schemas live under `context/schemas/`. Naming: `name.md` for inactive, `[name].md` for active (R2 covers brackets). Loader iterates the directory; reuses T-006 frontmatter reader. Both `.md` and `.json` accepted.

**Files:** `agi-tree/src/schema_registry/loader.py`, `agi-tree/tests/schema_registry/test_schema_files.py`, `agi-tree/tests/fixtures/schemas/example.md`, `agi-tree/tests/fixtures/schemas/example.json`

**Test Strategy:** Drop a new schema file into a fixture and assert it appears in the registry on next load without code changes.
