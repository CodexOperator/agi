const COMMON = `You are a research reader for the "local-maxxing" town of an AI research graph. READ-ONLY: never modify any repo, never install packages, never run training, never rent GPUs, never call paid APIs. You may run small read-only shell commands (ls, cat, grep, wc, python3 -c for JSON inspection) and use WebFetch/WebSearch (load via ToolSearch "select:WebFetch,WebSearch"). Quote sources with URL/path + date. Mark every number as MEASURED (from a file/page you read) or ESTIMATE. Never invent results.
Context the owner gave (verbatim-ish): the town's aim is to maximize the usefulness of ABSOLUTELY TINY models across all layers of the system; everything must run on CPU + ordinary RAM (this box: 4-core ARM Neoverse-N1 Ampere A1, 23 GB RAM, ~7 GB free, no GPU; a second headless box: 8 GB unified RAM, old Intel HD iGPU; Camber Cloud GPU: ONE extra-small 24 GB VRAM instance, hard budget 3 GPU-HOURS PER MONTH). Three visions: (1) there is always a more efficient way to infer on lighter hardware; (2) there is always a smarter way to infer that scores higher on benchmarks over time; (3) two or more tiny models cooperating are exponentially smarter than the sum. Town moral: not tokens saved, but KNOWLEDGE and WISDOM extracted per token spent, failures included. The owner wants many hypotheses chased in parallel, coalesced into further hypothesis sets sequentially, before any MVP. Owner's specific threads: the dead-head "coherence" pruning equation applied to head pruning AND to generating coupled-oscillator maps, imported into a spiking-neural-network architecture; a neuron-as-transistor-byte model (each neuron = a byte; fires by how many/which bits are set, in what order; bits map to upstream neurons' output bits; broadcast/subscribe; one bit out per tick); KV-cache compression + efficient streaming papers folded in; recurrent looped transformers (depth recurrence); candidate model line "qwen3.8 50b" (exact id unknown — resolve it).`

Then think hard about the owner's idea: could the same coherence quantity define coupling strengths between heads/neurons, i.e. generate a coupled-oscillator (Kuramoto-style) map? State precisely what would have to be true. Seeds must be CPU-runnable on 0.5B-class models.` },

Extract what the pipeline actually does end-to-end, what encoders exist (spike encodings? rate/latency/delta?), what runs on CPU, what is finished vs scaffold, test count and status. Which parts are reusable for tiny-model / SNN experiments now, with paths.` },

Extract: neuron models used (LIF? params), encodings, surrogate gradients, topologies, energy models, what was measured, what failed and WHY (the owner says pricing prediction had little success), what infrastructure is reusable. Then map the owner's neuron-as-transistor-byte idea onto what exists: which files would a bit-threshold neuron replace or extend.` },

If the exact page will not load, find the actual paper by search and say exactly which paper you read. Extract: the architecture (depth recurrence, how many loops, shared weights?), parameter count vs effective depth, benchmark results vs same-param and same-compute baselines, inference cost per token, whether loop count can be varied at inference (adaptive compute), training recipe and its cost, any released weights/code. Then digest it into an autoresearch-style chain of 4-6 hypotheses, each with claim/falsifier/CPU experiment on a tiny model (<=1B), each building on the previous.

For each: the measured gain, the condition under which it holds, and where it fails (correlated errors). Be honest about the "exponential" claim: what evidence supports super-additivity and what refutes it.

Also CPU-side: bit-packed integer kernels (popcount, AVX/NEON) for binary matmul. For each: what it is, measured results, what is reusable in software on a CPU. Then assess the owner's proposal frankly: what is novel, what has prior art, which parts are testable cheaply, and the biggest risk (e.g., no gradient path; hand-wired mappings do not scale).
