"""The GitHub Copilot CLI harness. `goal:g4.6`, third harness.

The parent hypothesis (`hypothesis:l4-copilot-cli-is-a-third-harness-with-the-
same-hooks-as-claude-code-and-pi`) claims the `copilot` binary is a third
spawn target that fits the existing adapter seam with **no edit to
`dispatch.py`**: one config entry plus this file. It is, and this file is the
proof — nothing here is imported by dispatch except through
`adapters.load()`, which reads `harnesses.copilot-cli.adapter`.

Five facts about the CLI shape the argv, each read from the installed binary
(v1.0.83) on 2026-09-14 rather than assumed:

  - **There is no system-prompt flag.** `copilot --help` has no
    `--append-system-prompt`, no `--append-system-prompt-file`, no
    `--system-prompt`. The documented instruction channels are AGENTS.md /
    repo custom instructions (`--no-custom-instructions` turns them off) and
    the `-p` prompt body itself. So the brief is assembled through
    `brief.assemble` exactly as pi and Claude Code do, then written into the
    session as `prompt.md` and handed to the CLI as the `-p` text — a LEADING
    INSTRUCTION BLOCK in the one turn the CLI runs. This is the fallback the
    parent claim allowed when "the only route is a leading instruction block
    in the prompt"; it is stated here because a reader who greps for a
    `--system-prompt` flag will not find one and must know why.
  - **`-p` is the non-interactive contract.** `-p, --prompt <text> Execute a
    prompt in non-interactive mode (exits after completion)`.
  - **`--allow-all-tools` is required for non-interactive mode** ("required
    for non-interactive mode", env `COPILOT_ALLOW_ALL`), so a `-p` run
    without it would block on the first tool prompt off a TTY.
  - **Auth is an environment token, not a keychain entry.** The CLI checks
    `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` > `GH_TOKEN` > `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Measured on this
    box: `copilot login --with-token` exits 1 with "Login succeeded, but the
    token was not saved. Install a system keychain", so NOTHING persists and
    every spawn must carry a token. `child_env` therefore resolves one (env
    first, then `gh auth token`) and injects it as `GH_TOKEN`; absent a token
    the spawn is left to fail as itself rather than being silently mangled
    here.
  - **`--model <name>` takes the config value verbatim.** The shipped row
    uses `auto` because this account's `models.list` returns only `auto`
    (experiment:a00-4e3f8a7b-8edc1e, conjunct 3), but the adapter still
    emits `--model <models[tier]>` so a Pro entitlement can name a model by
    editing one config cell, never this file.

Which credential a spawn needs: none of the OpenRouter kind. Copilot
authenticates through the GitHub token above, so `needs_credential` returns
False and dispatch mints no per-spawn OpenRouter key for it — the same rule
Claude Code's subscription auth already earned.
