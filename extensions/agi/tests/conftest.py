"""Collection-time tier gate (goal:g15.6, hypothesis:l4-full-suite-tier-gate).

A brief-level instruction is not a mechanism: text in a node cannot refuse
anything. This conftest makes the "run a targeted path, not the whole suite"
rule a real gate for kid agents.

The signal already exists -- dispatch.py exports AGI_TIER into every spawn's
environment (a kid runs under AGI_TIER=kid). We only READ it here; nothing
else in production changes and no existing test is edited.

RULE (fire before collection, exit uncollected):
  * AGI_TIER == "kid"  AND  the invocation is a BARE DIRECTORY run
    (no specific test file named, no -k filter)  ->  REFUSED, one-line reason.
  * any other case  ->  behaviour exactly as today, including a bare
    directory run at every tier other than kid.

Which hook and why: ``pytest_cmdline_main(config)``. It fires immediately
after the command line has been parsed but BEFORE any collection begins, so a
refusal cannot be bypassed by letting collection start. At that point
``config.args`` still holds the positional paths the invocation named and
``config.option.kw`` holds the -k filter; both are exactly what we need to
tell a bare directory run from a targeted one.

    """hypothesis:l4-conftest-tmux-guard — project-wide tmux guard, widened
    from test_send.py's old file-local `_SafeSubprocess`/`_no_real_tmux`
    (hypothesis:l4b23-fixture-leak, CLOSED proved but scoped to send.py only).

    Every test must never reach the live tmux session
    (`rotate.DEFAULT_TMUX_SESSION`, "agi-rc"), where a recipient whose name
    matches a real window would have text typed into a live agent's terminal.
    The guard answers any `tmux` subprocess call with a safe rc-1
    CompletedProcess (so `_nudge_window`/`_existing_windows` short-circuit to
    "no such session", exactly as the old `_SafeSubprocess` did for tmux).

    **Selective, not blanket**: every NON-tmux call (in particular the real
    `git` invocations test_season.py/test_rotate.py's own fixtures depend on)
    is passed through untouched to the real `subprocess.run`. Requesting a
    raise on any non-tmux call (the old `_SafeSubprocess` behaviour) would
    break those tests — see the L4.5x brief.

    Patch target: the real stdlib `subprocess.run`.
    send.py/rotate.py/season.py `import subprocess`, and mail_alert.py
    `import send` (whose module object `import subprocess` too), so every
    module's tmux call ultimately resolves through this one attribute — one
    fixture covers the whole suite. A per-module-alias patch would defeat
    the "project-wide" point.

    Override-precedence for the three `_fake_tmux` tests in test_send.py:
    they monkeypatch `send_mod.subprocess.run` (= this same global
    `subprocess.run`) in the TEST BODY, after this autouse fixture's setup, so
    their fake wins for the duration of the test. (monkeypatch is
    function-scoped, so the fixture's and the test's instances are the same;
    both revert at teardown.)
